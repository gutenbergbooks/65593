<h3 class="h3head">PREFACE</h3>

<p class="p2">No State has a history better calculated to inspire
patriotism in its people than has Kansas. In this fact
lies the greatest reason for teaching Kansas History in
the schools. A knowledge of the difficulties that have
been met and conquered in building the State will create
in the minds of the boys and girls a greater respect for
the sturdy qualities of the pioneers; it will give them a
wholesome sense of the great cost at which the ease and
comfort of to-day have been purchased; it will stimulate
in them a desire to live up to the past.</p>

<p>If the study of Kansas History is to accomplish these
results, the subject must be presented in such a way as
to arouse the interest of the pupils. They must feel its
reality. They must catch its spirit.</p>

<p>With the hope of fulfilling in some measure these requirements,
this book has been prepared with the following
aims constantly in mind: to make it, as nearly as
possible, a narrative; to select from the wealth of material
at hand such subject matter as is within the comprehension
of children, eliminating such matter as can be fully understood
and appreciated only by mature minds; to present
the general movement of the State’s progress rather than
a mass of unrelated facts. Only so much detail has been
used as is necessary to a clear understanding of events.
The purpose has not been to chronicle a multitude of
events, but rather to show forth what manner of men and
 <a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a><span class="pageno">6</span>
women were the builders of our State, what motives
actuated them, what conditions surrounded them, how
they lived, and what they accomplished.</p>

<p>An effort has been made to give the pupils a general
view of the State’s history as a whole, to give them a
framework on which to build their later knowledge, and
to leave them with a desire to learn more of Kansas
history.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">THE BEGINNING OF KANSAS HISTORY</h4>

<p class="p2"><strong>Introduction.</strong> More than four centuries have passed
since Columbus discovered America. During that time
the hunting ground of three hundred thousand Indians
has become the United States with its more than one
hundred million civilized people. In the center of this
great nation, which occupies nearly half the area of the
continent, lies Kansas, a rectangle four hundred miles
long and two hundred miles wide.</p>

<p>Kansas is a part of the great plain that slopes gradually
from the foothills of the Rocky Mountains to the Mississippi
River. Its surface, cut by many eastward-flowing
streams, lies level in the west but in the east curves into
countless hills and valleys.</p>

<p>On these broad prairies to-day are thousands of cattle,
and great fields of corn, wheat, and alfalfa. Towns and
cities are scattered over the State, and the country between
is dotted with the homes of farmers. There are
mines, factories, churches, schools, and colleges. Uniting
all are miles and miles of railroad. Kansas is now the
home of more than a million seven hundred thousand of
busy, prosperous people. But it was not always so; these
prairies were once used only by the Indian and the buffalo.
If we are to understand how this change has come about
we must begin with the coming of the first white men to
America.</p>

<p><strong>The First White Men in Kansas.</strong> At that time Spain
was the most powerful nation of Europe, and since she

had furnished the funds for the voyage of Columbus she
claimed the first right to America and became the pioneer
in the exploration of the New World. The Spaniards first
explored the Gulf of Mexico and Florida, discovered the
Pacific Ocean and the Mississippi River, and were the first
to sail around the world. In 1519 Cortez, a Spaniard,
landed on the present site of Vera Cruz and marched into
the heart of Mexico, the home of the Aztec Indians. He
made himself master of that great region and called it
New Spain. All of these expeditions were too far south to
reach what is now Kansas, but only a few more years were
to pass before this far-off country was to be explored by
the adventurous Spaniards, the first white men to set foot
on Kansas soil.</p>

<p><strong>Cabeza de Vaca.</strong> In 1528 Narvaez, a Spaniard, led
an exploring expedition westward from Florida along the
Gulf of Mexico. Through various misfortunes and hardships
nearly all of the party perished. One of the commanders,
Cabeza de Vaca, and three of his men were taken
prisoners by the Indians. After being held in captivity
nearly six years they succeeded in making their escape.
They fled westward, and after an adventurous journey of
nearly two years reached a Spanish settlement near the
western coast of New Spain. The exact route followed by
Cabeza de Vaca and his companions can never be known,
but his accounts of their wanderings were largely the cause
of the expedition of Coronado, who was the first white
man known with certainty to have traveled across what is
now Kansas.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose of the Spaniards.</strong> The chief purpose of all the
Spanish explorers was to search for wealth. Cortez is said
to have made this remark to the Indians: “We Spaniards
are troubled with a disease of the heart for which we find
gold, and gold only, a specific remedy.” The hope of
 <a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a><span class="pageno">11</span>
finding gold and precious stones lying about like pebbles
lured many Spaniards into enterprises filled with terrible
hardships. Reports of great cities of untold wealth to the
northward, the “Seven Cities of Cibola,” as they were
called, had reached New Spain at various times, and when
Cabeza de Vaca told similar tales that he had heard from
the Indians it stirred the Spaniards to explore the region.</p>

<p><strong>Coronado.</strong> Great preparation was made for an expedition.
An army of three hundred Spaniards and eight
hundred friendly Indians was gathered and placed under
the command of Coronado. This was a large army for
those times and the burden of furnishing it with arms and
supplies fell heavily on New Spain. But so hopeful were
the people of the success of the expedition that no sacrifice
seemed too great. In the spring of 1540 the long march
into unexplored country began.</p>

<p><strong>The Search for Quivira.</strong> After months of travel in a
northerly and then in a northeasterly direction, Coronado
and his army reached the province of Cibola, which was
probably in the western part of what is now New Mexico,
and the “Seven Cities” proved to be ordinary adobe
Indian villages. They took possession of the Indian supplies
and spent the winter in the villages. The Indians,
anxious to get rid of their unwelcome visitors, persuaded
a Quivira Indian, whom they held as a prisoner, to tell
the Spaniards tales of the wonderful land of Quivira in
order to lead them off into the wilderness where they would
die from lack of food and water. Coronado and his men
listened to this Indian, whom they called “Turk,” and
followed him as a guide for many days. He led them
steadily toward the east, and after a time they became
convinced that they were being deceived and made him
confess that Quivira was far to the northward. They had
been only too willing to listen to Turk’s stories, but when
 <a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a><span class="pageno">12</span>
they learned that he had misled them they put him to
death. Supplies were now low and Coronado sent back
the main body of the army, which was composed of footmen,
and with thirty horsemen started northward.</p>

<p><strong>Coronado in Kansas.</strong> It must be remembered that the
whole country was a vast wilderness without names or
boundary lines, and we can describe the journey of the
Spaniards only by using names and boundary lines that
have come into existence long since that time. As nearly
as can be learned, Coronado and his men entered Kansas
about where Clark County now is, and went on northward,
crossing the Arkansas River at or near the site of Dodge
City. From this point they followed the river to Great
 <a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a><span class="pageno">13</span>
Bend, and then continued in a northeasterly direction to
the vicinity of Junction City. At the end of their journey
they set up a cross bearing the inscription: “Francisco
Vasqueth de Coronado, commander of an expedition, arrived
at this place.”</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>Quivira Found.</strong> After all this weary journey they had
reached Quivira and found it to be merely the home of a
tribe of Indians, the Quiviras, later known as the Pawnees.
Coronado wrote in a letter to the King of Spain:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“The country itself is the best I have ever seen for
producing all of the fruits of Spain, for, besides the land
itself being very fat and black, and being very well watered
by rivulets, springs, and rivers, I found prunes like those
in Spain and nuts and very good sweet grapes and mulberries.
I remained twenty-five days in this province of
Quivira, both to see and explore the country, and to find
out whether there was anything beyond which could be
of service to your Majesty, because the guides who had
 <a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a><span class="pageno">14</span>
brought me had given me an account of other provinces
beyond this. And what I am sure of is that there is not
any gold or any other metal in all that country, and the
other things of which they told me are nothing but little
villages, and in many of these they do not plant anything,
and do not have any houses, except of skins and sticks,
and they wander around with the cows. So that the
account they gave me was false, because they wanted to
get me to go there with the whole force, believing that as
the way was through such uninhabitable deserts, and from
lack of water they would get us where our horses and we
would die of thirst. And the guides confessed this, and
they said they did it by the advice of the natives of these
provinces.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Coronado’s Return to New Spain.</strong> Empty-handed,
Coronado and his little band of Spanish knights turned
toward New Spain and carried to their waiting countrymen
the disappointing story of their two years’ expedition.
With this event fifty years had passed since the
discovery of America, and for the next two and a half
centuries little attention was paid to the Kansas country.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">SUMMARY</p>

<p class="blockquote">The history of Kansas begins with the first exploration
of this country by white men nearly four hundred years
ago. Spain was the first nation to explore the New World.
The chief purpose of the Spaniards was to find gold.
They had heard from the Indians of rich cities to the
northward, and when Cabeza de Vaca told them similar
tales the people of New Spain decided to explore the
country. They sent Coronado with a large army on a
journey of exploration lasting two years. He failed to find
gold, but his expedition is of interest because he was the
first white man known to have traversed what is now
Kansas.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">KANSAS BECOMES A PART OF THE UNITED STATES</h4>

<p class="p2"><strong>The French.</strong> While the Spaniards were searching for
wealth in the southern part of North America the French
were trading with the Indians in the northern part along
the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Lawrence River and around the Great Lakes.
Among the French were many Catholic priests, called
Jesuits, who came to carry their religious faith to the
Indians. In 1673, one of these Jesuits, Father Marquette,
accompanied a trader named Joliet on an expedition to
explore the Mississippi River. They launched their canoes
on the great river and floated downstream for hundreds of
miles, between shores that in some places were thickly
wooded, and in others were grassy plains. They went as
far south as the mouth of the Arkansas River, and then
turned and began the long, hard task of paddling back.</p>

<p><strong>La Salle and Louisiana, 1682.</strong> Among those who heard
of the journey of Marquette and Joliet was a young Frenchman,
La Salle. He planned to explore the whole Mississippi
basin and to take possession of it in the name of
the King of France. In 1682, with a few companions, he
floated down the Mississippi to its mouth. Here, with
much ceremony, they planted a cross, buried a leaden
plate inscribed with the arms of France, and declared that
all the land drained by the Mississippi River and its tributaries
should belong to France, and should be named
Louisiana in honor of the French King, Louis <abbr title="Fourteen">XIV.</abbr>
Thus in 1682, nearly two centuries after the discovery of
America, Kansas came into the possession of the French.</p>

<p><strong>The End of Spanish and French Explorations.</strong> The
French soon planted a few colonies and forts along the
Mississippi River and sent out explorers, some of whom
 <a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a><span class="pageno">17</span>
may have entered the present bounds of Kansas. This
roused the Spaniards in Mexico, who wished to hold the
territory for Spain, and they also sent expeditions. The
armies of both nations suffered severely at the hands of
the Indians and the exploration of the Kansas country
was given up by both Spain and France, and for nearly a
century more it lay almost forgotten. The next exploration
of this territory was by people of another nation.</p>

<p><strong>The English.</strong> While the Spaniards were busy in the
South and the French in the North, another people, the
English, began to make explorations in the new continent.
They did not come to hunt for gold, nor to trade with the
Indians, but to found homes. They settled along the
Atlantic coast between the French in Canada and the
Spaniards in Florida, and claimed the country westward
to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p><strong>Conflict of French and English Claims.</strong> As time went
on and the settlements increased in number, the claims
of the French and the English conflicted and caused
much strife between the colonies of the two countries.
The question of the ownership of the land was not settled
until the close of the French and Indian War in 1763.
As a result of this war France gave up all her claims in
America, practically everything east of the Mississippi to
England, and that west of it to Spain. In 1800 Spain
ceded her portion of America back to France.</p>

<p><strong>The Louisiana Purchase, 1803.</strong> In the meantime the
English colonies had fought the Revolutionary War and
become an independent nation. In 1803, when Thomas
Jefferson was President, the United States bought from
France her tract of country lying west of the Mississippi
River. This was known as the Louisiana Purchase, and
the date is one to be remembered, for it marks the end of
 <a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a><span class="pageno">18</span>
French claims in America, and it marks the time when
what is now Kansas became a part of the United States.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_2" id="fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>One Century More.</strong> More than three centuries of
American history had passed and the country west of the
Mississippi River remained unsettled and practically unknown.
The Spaniard and the Frenchman had come and
gone, but the Indian still hunted the buffalo on the prairies.
The white man had not yet made his home in the Kansas
country.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">SUMMARY</p>

<p class="blockquote">Spain explored in the South in search of wealth, France
in the North to trade in furs with the Indians, and England
along the coast between these two to establish homes.
Spain claimed the Kansas country because of the exploration
by Coronado, France through the claims of Marquette
and La Salle, and England through the ocean-to-ocean
claim. None of the nations succeeded in accomplishing
anything here, and the Kansas country was left alone for
nearly a century after it came into the possession of France.
At the close of the French and Indian War the country
west of the Mississippi was ceded to Spain. Later it came
again into the hands of France, and was purchased by the
United States in 1803.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">EXPLORATION OF THE KANSAS COUNTRY BY THE
UNITED STATES</h4>

<p class="p2"><strong>President Jefferson Sent Explorers.</strong> When the United
States bought Louisiana the country from the Mississippi
River to the Pacific Ocean was a vast unknown area.
President Jefferson was eager to learn something about
the great West, and sent out several exploring parties.</p>

<p><strong>Lewis and Clark.</strong> The first expedition, sent in 1804,
the year following the purchase of Louisiana, was in charge
of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. They were instructed
to move up the Missouri River and on to the
Pacific Ocean. After a difficult journey lasting two and a
half years the party returned to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis and brought to
the people of the United States much important information
concerning the West. It is the part of their journey
along the border of what is now Kansas in which we are
most interested.</p>

<p><strong>The Journey.</strong> With about forty-five men and three
boats Lewis and Clark started up the Missouri River in
the spring of 1804. Two horsemen rode along the bank to
hunt and bring in game, which was to go far toward supplying
provisions for the expedition. After a five weeks’
journey they reached the mouth of the Kansas River, and
encamped that night on the present site of Kansas City,
Kansas. From there they continued up the Missouri
River where it forms the present boundary line of Kansas,
along the border of what has since become Leavenworth,
Atchison, and Doniphan counties. Their account of the
journey describes the country through which they passed
and the different Indian tribes and villages they saw. It
speaks of an Indian tribe as “hunting on the plains for
 <a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a><span class="pageno">21</span>
buffalo which our hunters have seen for the first time.”
Again we read, “Pecan trees were this day seen, and large
quantities of deer and wild turkey.” By July 4 they had
reached a point not far from the present city of Atchison.
They did not have the means for much of a celebration,
but their observance of the day included the firing of
“an evening gun” and the naming of two streams, Fourth
of July Creek, and Independence Creek. Independence
Creek still retains its name. A week later they passed the
fortieth parallel, which afterward became the northern
boundary of Kansas, and continued on their way to the
Pacific.</p>

<p><strong>Pike’s Expedition.</strong> In 1806 another exploring party
was sent out in command of Zebulon Montgomery Pike,
a young lieutenant in the army. He was instructed to
ascend the Missouri River, visit the various Indian tribes
in the Kansas country, go west until the frontier of New
Mexico was reached, then south toward the source of the
Red River which he was to descend to the Mississippi,
and thence to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, the starting point. The journey
did not, however, follow just this route.</p>

<p><strong>Pike Visits the Osage Indians.</strong> The Osage Indians
lived in the eastern part of Kansas, south of the Kansas
River. At their villages Pike purchased supplies for the
overland journey. From there he went west and then
northwest toward the Pawnee village which is believed to
have been within the bounds of what is now Republic
County.</p>

<p><strong>Pike Among the Pawnees.</strong> About the time he crossed
the Solomon River he came upon the trail of Spanish
troops. It seems that the authorities in Mexico had in
some way heard of the Pike expedition and had sent an
army of five hundred men to intercept him. These forces
missed each other, but when Pike reached the village of
 <a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a><span class="pageno">22</span>
the Pawnee Indians he found them in possession of many
blankets, bridles, saddles, and other things which they
had received from the Spaniards. After having been
visited with much ceremony by the mounted and lordly
army from Mexico, the Indians were not inclined to be
courteous to Pike and his score of dusty, bedraggled footmen.
After much unpleasantness and delay a council
attended by four hundred warriors was held. In his opening
address Pike spoke, among other things, of the numerous
Spanish flags in the village. Pointing to one which
floated above the tent of the head chief, he demanded
that it be lowered and that an American flag be put in its
place. Several Indians made speeches without mentioning
the flag. Pike again told them they must choose between
the Spanish and the American governments. The Americans
awaited the answer in anxious suspense. Finally an
old chief arose. He slowly hauled down the Spanish flag,
laid it at Pike’s feet, and received the American flag in
return. This he unfurled above the chiefs tent, and for
the first time, so far as is known, the Stars and Stripes
floated over Kansas.</p>

<p><strong>Pike in Colorado.</strong> From this place Pike and his men
moved southwest to the Arkansas River, where the party
divided, some of them going down the river and on home.
Pike and his remaining men, instead of searching for the
Red River according to instructions, followed the Arkansas
River into what is now Colorado. They pushed westward,
and after many days of travel sighted a mountain, which
appeared at first like a small blue cloud but which proved
to be a great bald peak of the Rocky Mountains. This
peak has since been named Pike’s Peak in honor of the
explorer. By this time it was winter and their supplies
were low. Pike and his men suffered terribly from cold
and hunger while wandering among the mountains. Hoping
 <a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a><span class="pageno">23</span>
to better their condition they moved toward the southwest,
only to find themselves taken prisoners in Spanish
territory. Later, however, they were escorted across Texas
to the American frontier in Louisiana and released.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->


<p><strong>The Return of Pike.</strong> A whole year had passed before
they found themselves again in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, a year of hardship
for them, but well worth while, nevertheless, for Pike
brought back a great deal of valuable information. That
he was a better soldier than farmer may be seen from this
passage taken from his journal:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“From these immense prairies may rise one great advantage
to the United States, <abbr title="namely">viz.</abbr>, the restriction of our
population to certain limits, and thereby a continuation
of the union. Our citizens, being so prone to rambling
and extending themselves on the frontiers, will, through
necessity, be constrained to limit their extent on the west
to the borders of the Missouri and the Mississippi, while
they leave the prairies, incapable of cultivation, to the
wandering aborigines of the country.”<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></span></p>
<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a><span class="pageno">24</span>

<p><strong>The Great American Desert.</strong> Another explorer, Major
Long, who came in 1819 and 1820, likewise expressed the
idea that most of the country was unfit for cultivation,
and therefore uninhabitable by an agricultural people.
He even went so far as to say the country bore a “resemblance
to the deserts of Siberia.” Washington Irving, the
great writer, said of this region: “It could be well named,
the Great American Desert. It spreads forth into undulating
and treeless plains and desolate sandy wastes,
wearisome to the eye from their extent and monotony.
It is a land where no man permanently abides, for at
certain seasons of the year there is no food for the hunter
or his steed.”</p>

<p>The views of these men largely molded public opinion
concerning the West. The country out of which has been
carved such prosperous agricultural states as Oklahoma,
 <a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a><span class="pageno">25</span>
Kansas, and Nebraska was, a hundred years ago, known
as the “Great American Desert,” and was so named on
the maps of that time.</p>

<p><strong>Indian Tribes in Kansas.</strong> The western prairies had for
untold ages been occupied by Indians. At the time of
Pike’s expedition there were four tribes living within the
present bounds of Kansas. These were the Kanza, the
Osage, the Pawnee, and the Comanche tribes. The Kanza,
or Kaw, Indians lived in the northeastern part of the State
and were the ones seen by
Lewis and Clark in their
expedition up the Missouri
River. It is from this
tribe that Kansas probably
received its name. The
Osage Indians were located
in the eastern part,
south of the Kansas River.
The Pawnee tribe lived
north and west of the
Kanza Indians. It was in
the Osage village that Pike
secured supplies for his
journey, and in the Pawnee
village that he caused the
Spanish flag to be lowered.
The Pawnees were once called the Quiviras. The first of
their tribe that we know anything about was “Turk,”
who led Coronado into the wilderness. These three tribes
lived in permanent homes and had their tribal villages,
but the fourth tribe were wanderers. They were the
Comanches, sometimes called the Padoucas, and they
roved over the western part of Kansas and adjacent
territory, hunting buffaloes and following the herds as
 <a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a><span class="pageno">26</span>
they grazed from place to place. They were fine horsemen,
and brave, but very fierce and warlike.</p>

<p><strong>The Kansas of a Century Ago.</strong> This was the Kansas of
a century ago. At that time it had received neither name
nor boundaries. For the first fifty years that this region
was a part of the United States, that is, from the purchase
of Louisiana until Kansas was organized as a territory in
1854, the country was little used by the white people except
as a pathway to the West.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">SUMMARY</p>

<p class="blockquote">President Jefferson, wishing to learn something of the
unknown western country, sent out two exploring expeditions.
The first, in 1804, was in charge of Lewis and
Clark, who were to follow the Missouri River and to go
on across the mountains until they reached the Pacific
coast. They passed along the northeast border of Kansas.
The next exploring party was in command of Pike. His
route was somewhat in the form of a circle. Beginning
at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis it was to pass through Kansas, then south,
then east, and up the Mississippi to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis. He visited
the Osage Indians in eastern Kansas, the Pawnee Indians
in northern Kansas where he raised the American flag,
and then marched into Colorado where he discovered
Pike’s Peak. From Colorado he went into what is now
New Mexico, where he was taken prisoner by the Spaniards.
They took him nearly to the Mississippi River and
released him. On his return he reported this country as
unfit for settlement, and his opinion was shared by later
explorers. At the time of Pike’s expedition there were
four tribes of Indians in Kansas, the Osages, the Kanzas,
the Pawnees, and the Comanches.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">KANSAS AS A PATHWAY</h4>

<p class="p2"><strong>Mexico a Century Ago.</strong> Nearly three centuries passed
from the time Cortez led the Spaniards into Mexico until
Kansas became a part of the United States. During those
years Spanish settlements had increased in number until
at the time of Pike’s expedition Mexico included most of
what is now California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New
Mexico, and Colorado.</p>

<p><strong>Old Santa Fe.</strong> Santa Fe, said to be the second oldest
city in the United States, was the most important point
on the northern frontier of Mexico. In those days it was
not like the busy American Santa Fe of to-day. It had
about two thousand inhabitants, practically all Spaniards,
and they lived in little adobe houses arranged around a
public square after the manner of Spanish cities.</p>

<p><strong>Origin of the Santa Fe Trail.</strong> The “Great American
Desert” lay between Santa Fe and the settlements of the
western border of the United States. But Captain Pike’s
interesting descriptions of the wealth and resources of the
Spanish country stirred up enthusiasm, and Americans
began to make their way across the plains to trade with
the Spaniards. Santa Fe soon became an important trading
point for all of northeastern Mexico. The traders, on
their journeys to the Spanish city, wore a pathway that
crossed the length of Kansas. This pathway came to be
called the “Santa Fe Trail.”</p>

<p><strong>Captain Becknell the First Trader.</strong> Although a few
earlier trips were made, the trade with Santa Fe really
began in the year 1822 with the journey of Captain Becknell,
of Missouri. He had started out the year before to
trade with the Indians, and had gone on with a party of
 <a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a><span class="pageno">31</span>
Mexican rangers to Santa Fe where he sold his small supply
of merchandise so profitably that he decided to try again
on a larger scale. In 1822 he took about thirty men and
five thousand dollars’ worth of merchandise. His success
encouraged others, and a regular trade with Santa Fe was
soon established.</p>

<p><strong>Merchandise Carried on Pack Mules</strong>. For several years
most of the transportation along the Trail was done with
pack mules. A caravan of pack mules usually numbered
from fifty to two hundred, each animal carrying about
three hundred pounds of merchandise. From the earliest
times the Mexicans had used pack mules as a means of
transportation, and were skilled in handling them. For
this reason the American traders usually employed Mexicans
for the work of the pack train. The average rate of
travel of a mule train was from twelve to fifteen miles a
day. Since the Trail was nearly eight hundred miles long,
fifty to sixty days were required for the trip.</p>

<p><strong>Wagons Used on the Trail</strong>. Probably the first time
that wagons were used was in 1824, when a company of
traders left Missouri with twenty-five wagons and a train
of pack mules. This experiment was so satisfactory that
the use of wagons soon became general and mules were
used less and less as pack animals.</p>

<p><strong>The Traders and the Indians</strong>. Travel over the Santa
Fe Trail rapidly increased, and the history of those days
is filled with stories of exciting adventure, of danger, of
privation, and of deeds of courage. The source of greatest
danger and excitement was the Indians, for they did not
take kindly to the white men’s use of their hunting grounds.
For several years the traders crossed the plains in small
parties, each man taking only two or three hundred dollars’
worth of goods, and they were seldom molested. But peace
did not last long. The Indians soon learned more about
 <a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a><span class="pageno">32</span>
the journeys of the traders and how to estimate the value
of their stock. Also, many of the traders considered every
Indian a deadly enemy and killed all that fell into their
power simply because some wrong was known to have
been committed by Indians. This treatment tended to
stir up the hatred of the red men and to make them watch
every opportunity for revenge.</p>

<p>An example of the enmity between the Indians and the
traders may be seen in an occurrence of 1828. Two young
men went to sleep on the bank of a stream a short distance
from their caravan, and were fatally shot, it was supposed,
with their own guns. When their comrades found them
one was dead, and the other died by the time the caravan
reached the Cimarron River, about forty miles farther on.
During the simple burial ceremonies a party of six or
seven Indians appeared on the other side of the river. It
is probable that these Indians knew nothing of the crime
committed or they would not have approached the white
men. Some of the men took this view, but, against their
advice, the others fired and killed all of the Indians but
one, who escaped to carry the news to his tribe. The
Indians of the wronged tribe then followed the caravan
to the Arkansas River where they robbed the traders of
nearly a thousand head of horses and mules. Other robberies
and murders followed until it became necessary for
the traders to petition the National Government for troops.
The next year soldiers escorted the caravan nearly to the
Cimarron River. Government protection was furnished
again in 1834, and in 1843. In the other years the traders
fought their own way, but the day of small parties was
over. For mutual protection, the traders banded together.
A single big caravan started out each spring as soon as
the grass was sufficient to pasture their animals, and returned
in the fall.</p>
<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a><span class="pageno">33</span>

<p><strong>The Starting Point of the Traders.</strong> For many years the
city of Franklin, on the Missouri River, was the starting
point of the traders, the place where they purchased their
goods and their outfits. Later, Independence, Missouri,
and finally Westport which is now a part of Kansas City,
became the emporium of the Santa Fe trade. The tourists
and traders began to gather about the first of May for the
journey that would begin near the middle of that month.</p>

<p><strong>Supplies Taken.</strong> The ordinary supplies to be taken for
each man were about fifty pounds of flour, fifty pounds of
bacon, ten pounds of coffee, twenty pounds each of sugar,
rice, and beans, and a little salt. Anything else was considered
an unnecessary luxury and was seldom taken.
The buffalo furnished fresh meat for the travelers.</p>

<p><strong>Teams and Wagons.</strong> After the first few years horses
were little used on the Trail except for riding. A wagon
was usually drawn by eight mules or oxen, though some of
the larger ones required ten or twelve. The large wagons
often carried as much as five thousand pounds of merchandise
and supplies. The loading of the wagons for a journey
of nearly eight hundred miles was a very particular piece
of work.</p>

<p><strong>Council Grove the Meeting Place.</strong> Although the traders
banded together in one big caravan, they did not all
start from the same place nor at the same time. The
Kanza and Osage Indians seldom committed worse deeds
than petty thievery, and the more warlike Comanches and
Pawnees did not often appear along the first two hundred
miles of the Trail. The place where all the wagons
united to form a caravan was Council Grove, a point
about one hundred and fifty miles west of Independence.
In those days Council Grove consisted of a strip of fine
timber along the Neosho valley. It is said to have been
named in 1825 by the United States Commissioners who
 <a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a><span class="pageno">34</span>
met on this spot some Osage Indians, with whom they
made a treaty for the right of way for the Santa Fe Trail.
About 1850 a blacksmith
shop and two or
three traders’ stores
were established at
Council Grove and this
place became “the last
chance for supplies” for
westbound travelers.</p>

<p><strong>Journeys of Gregg.</strong>
We can not get an idea
of those days in a better
way, perhaps, than
by following an account
of one of the caravans.
Josiah Gregg, who
crossed the prairie eight
times, has left a very
interesting record of his
experiences. Many of
the following facts are
taken from his account
of the journey of 1831.</p>

<p><strong>Organization of the
Caravan.</strong> For this particular
trip there were two hundred men and nearly a
hundred wagons, with a dozen smaller vehicles, and two
carriages carrying cannon. The total value of the merchandise
was about $200,000. For so large an undertaking
it was, of course, necessary to have some kind of organization.
According to custom, therefore, they elected
officers and adopted a set of rules. The head man was the
“Captain of the Caravan,” who directed the order of
 <a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a><span class="pageno">35</span>
travel, selected the camping grounds, and performed many
other duties of a general nature. The wagons were
divided into four groups, each group under the charge of a
lieutenant, who selected crossings and superintended the
“forming” of the camp. The men were well armed with
rifles, shotguns, and an abundant supply of pistols and
knives.</p>

<p><strong>The Starting of the Caravan.</strong> When the time came to
start from Council Grove the command “Catch up!
Catch up!” sounded by the captain and passed on to all
the groups, started a scene of hurry and uproar as the
teamsters vied with each other to be first to shout “All’s
set!” After a period of shouting at animals, the clanking
of chains, and the rattling of harness and yokes, all were
ready. The command “Stretch out!” was given, and the
line of march began.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

 <p class="caption"><span class="sc">Crossing the Plains.</span></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>The Country West of Council Grove.</strong> Council Grove
seemed to form the western boundary of the very rich,
fertile, and well timbered country. From here westward
the streams were lined with but little timber growth, and
 <a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a><span class="pageno">36</span>
much of that was cottonwood. The country was mostly
prairie, with the vegetation gradually becoming more
scarce. The traders usually lashed under their wagons a
supply of logs for needed repairs, for Council Grove furnished
the last good wood they would pass. Westward
from Council Grove not a single human habitation, not
even an Indian settlement, was to be seen along the whole
route. It is difficult to imagine such a condition in Kansas
only eighty years ago.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

 <p class="caption"><span class="sc">North American Bison, Commonly Called Buffaloes.</span></p>
<p class="p0 center smaller">They were described by Cabeza de Vaca as “crooked-backed oxen.”</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>Buffaloes Sighted.</strong> Soon after leaving Council Grove
the traders began watching for buffaloes, and when a small
herd was sighted it created much excitement. About half
the men had never seen these animals before. All the
horsemen rushed toward the herd, and some of the drivers
even left their teams and followed on foot.</p>

<p><strong>Pawnee Rock.</strong> After a few more days of travel, during
which nothing more serious happened than a few false
alarms of Indians, they reached the Arkansas River.
Another day’s travel over a level plain brought them in
 <a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a><span class="pageno">37</span>
sight of Pawnee Rock, a great rock standing on the plains
near the Big Bend of the Arkansas, and a landmark
known from one end of the Trail to the other. The surrounding
country was not
occupied by any tribe of Indians,
but was claimed by all
of them as a hunting ground,
for it was a fine pasture for
buffaloes. For many years it
had been the scene of bloody
battles between different
tribes. The Rock afforded an
excellent hiding place and retreat.
Since the old Trail
passed within a few yards of it,
this became a dreaded spot
for the traders, for at this point
they seldom escaped a skirmish with the Indians. The
Rock probably received its name from some of the bloody
deeds of the Pawnees, who were especially connected with
these scenes.</p>

 <p class="caption"><span class="sc">Pawnee Rock.</span></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>Forming Camp.</strong> When the caravan camped at Ash
Creek the traders found a few old moccasins scattered
around and some camp fires still burning, which seemed to
indicate the near presence of Indians. They had, up to
this point, marched in two columns, but after crossing
Pawnee Fork they formed four lines for better protection
in case of attack. In camp the wagons were arranged in
the form of a hollow square, each line forming a side.
This provided an enclosure for the animals when needed,
and a fortification against the Indians. Ordinarily the
camp fires were lighted outside the square, the men slept
on the ground there, and the animals were picketed near.</p>
<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a><span class="pageno">38</span>

<p><strong>The Caches.</strong> The next important stopping place was
The Caches, near the present site of Fort Dodge. All that
marked this spot from the surrounding country was a
group of pits in the ground. A number of years before, a
small party of traders had attempted to go to Santa Fe
in the fall. By the time they reached the Arkansas River
a heavy snowstorm forced them to take shelter on a large
island, where they were kept for three months by the
severe winter. During this time most of their animals
perished. When spring came, having no way to carry their
goods, they made some caches,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></span> where they stored their
merchandise until they could bring mules to haul it to
Santa Fe.</p>

<p><strong>The Trail Divided into Two Routes.</strong> At Cimarron Crossing
the Trail divided, and did not reunite until within a
few miles of Santa Fe. The southern route was shorter,
but it meant crossing fifty miles of desert before reaching
the Cimarron River. In all that stretch of level plain
there was no trail, nor landmark, nor stream of water.
Travelers sometimes lost their way in this desert, and unless
they had prepared for this part of the journey by taking
along a sufficient supply of water, they perished of
thirst.</p>

<p><strong>An Experience with Indians.</strong> This caravan decided to
take the southern route. A band of Indians soon appeared,
carrying an American flag as a token of peace.
They talked with the traders by means of signs and told
them there were immense numbers of Indians ahead. A
little later a band of warriors appeared and threatened to
 <a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a><span class="pageno">39</span>
fight. There was great excitement as the caravan prepared
for battle and the Indians continued to pour over the hills.
But there was no fighting, for the chief came forward with
his “peace pipe,” from which the captain took a whiff.
The warriors were ordered back to rejoin the long train of
squaws and papooses who were following with the baggage.
There were probably three thousand Indians in this party,
and they moved down into the valley and pitched their
wigwams. The traders felt sure that since the women and
children were along the Indians would not be hostile, and
they, therefore, formed their camp a few hundred yards
away. The Indians gathered around to gaze at the wagons,
for it was probably the first time most of them had ever
seen such vehicles. Some of them followed to the next
camp, and the next day a large number of them gathered
around the caravan. This sort of thing continued until
the traders made up a present of fifty or sixty dollars’
worth of goods to “seal the treaty of peace.”</p>

<p><strong>Their First News.</strong> Some days later the caravan met a
Mexican buffalo hunter. He told the traders the news
from Santa Fe, the first they had heard since the return of
the caravan of the year before. To-day Kansas City and
Santa Fe are little more than twenty-four hours apart by
rail, and we read the latest news from both places in the
morning and evening papers.</p>

<p><strong>Round Mound.</strong> Round Mound, standing nearly a
thousand feet above the level of the surrounding plain, in
what is now New Mexico, was one of the landmarks along
the Trail. At that point the caravan had completed about
three-fourths of the journey to Santa Fe. As they approached
the Mound some of the party decided to ascend
it. They felt certain that it could not be more than half a
mile away, but they had to go fully three miles before
reaching it. This remarkable deception in distance is
 <a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a><span class="pageno">40</span>
characteristic of the West.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></span> Nothing of particular note
occurred from Round Mound to the end of the journey.</p>

<p><strong>Arrival at Santa Fe.</strong> The arrival of the caravan at
Santa Fe was a source of excitement for both the traders
and the city and was celebrated with much festivity. The
traders had entered what was in those days a foreign
country and had to pay duties on their goods at the custom
house. Then came the business of selling these goods to
those who had come in from the surrounding country to
buy, after which the traders, or freighters as they were
often called, prepared for the long return journey, planning
to finish the round trip before the winter began. This was
but one of many trips made over the Santa Fe Trail.</p>

<p><strong>Travel Across Kansas During the ’40’s.</strong> There was a
war between the United States and Mexico in 1846-’48.
The trouble between the two countries checked the Santa
Fe trade between the years 1843 and 1850, but even under
those circumstances there was much travel across Kansas
 <a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a><span class="pageno">41</span>
during the ’40’s.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></span> There were four principal classes of
travelers: soldiers, emigrants to Oregon, Mormons, and
California gold seekers.</p>

<p><strong>The Soldiers.</strong> The war with Mexico broke out in 1846,
and many of the United States soldiers were sent to that
country by way of the Santa Fe Trail. This increased the
travel across the prairies.</p>

<p><strong>The Oregon Settlers.</strong> The remote unsettled region in
the Northwest, known as Oregon, was soon to become the
home of civilized people. In 1842 wagon trains of emigrants
began to undertake the long and weary journey to
that far-off country. Others soon followed, and during
the next few years many thousands of people settled in
the Oregon country.</p>

<p><strong>The Mormons.</strong> In those days the Mormon Church had
not been long established, but their beliefs had brought
the Mormons into trouble with the people around them
and with the Government, and they had been forced to
move several times. The last time was in 1845, when they
left Nauvoo, Illinois, and began the long and perilous
journey to the valley of Great Salt Lake, in which region
the main body of them remains to-day.</p>

<p><strong>The “Forty-niners.”</strong> In 1848 a man named James
Marshall, who was running a sawmill near the present site
of Sacramento, California, discovered shining particles of
gold in the mill race, and it was soon found that there were
rich gold fields in that part of the country. The news
spread, not rapidly as it would to-day, for there were no
railroad or telegraph lines west of the Mississippi River
 <a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a><span class="pageno">42</span>
and only a few east of it, but within a short time the whole
country and even Europe had heard of the California gold
fields, and people from all parts of the world began to
make their way to the Pacific coast. Some went by water
but more of them made the journey overland. Long lines
of wagons, or prairie schooners as they were called, wound
their way across the plains and over the mountains to
California. It is estimated that ninety thousand people
passed through Kansas on their way to California during
the two years 1848 and 1849, a few of them to gain wealth,
but thousands to be disappointed, and many to perish on
the way.</p>

<p><strong>The Oregon Trail.</strong> The Oregon settlers, the Mormons,
and the gold seekers entered Kansas at or near Atchison,
Leavenworth, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Joseph, or Westport, and moved toward
the northwest, crossed the border into Nebraska, and went
on across the mountains. The road worn by this westward-moving
stream of emigrants was known as the
Oregon Trail, though it was sometimes called the Mormon
Trail, and more often the California Road. For two
thousand miles the Oregon Trail stretched away through
an utter wilderness, and every mile of it came to be the
scene of hardship and suffering, of battle, or of death.
It was one of the most remarkable highways in history.
It had several branches, and in many places it followed
different routes at different times. The largest number
of travelers over this Trail entered Kansas at Westport
and followed for a short distance the Santa Fe Trail.
Near the present town of Gardner stood a signboard on
which were the words, “Road to Oregon.” At this point
the two historic highways divided. It has been said that,
“never before nor since has so simple an announcement
pointed the way to so long and hard a journey.”</p>
<a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a><span class="pageno">43</span>

<p class="p2 center ls">SUMMARY</p>

<p class="blockquote">The Santa Fe Trail was a great road about 775 miles
long, beginning successively at the Missouri towns, Franklin,
Independence, and Westport, and extending westward
to Santa Fe. Four hundred miles of its length were in
Kansas. Travel began in 1822 for the purpose of trading
with Mexico. The first merchandise was carried on pack
mules, but wagons began to be used in 1824. The traders
experienced much trouble with the Indians, and in 1829
they began going together in big caravans for protection.
The gathering place was Council Grove, where they
organized and started. A few of the well-known sites
along the Trail were Pawnee Rock, Ash Creek, Pawnee
Fork, and The Caches. At Cimarron Crossing the Trail
divided. The northern branch followed the Arkansas and
crossed the mountains over practically the same route as
that followed by the Santa Fe Railway to-day. The
southern branch was the cut-off across the desert. Another
historic highway was the Oregon Trail, sometimes
called the Mormon Trail and sometimes the California
Road. This Trail crossed the northeast corner of Kansas.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">KANSAS AS AN INDIAN COUNTRY</h4>

<p class="p2"><strong>Kansas Belonged to the Indians.</strong> During the years
when the white men were traveling back and forth across
Kansas they were not making settlements here. The
country remained in the undisputed possession of the
Indians. The white men did not want it as yet. They
looked upon these vast prairies, not as a resource, but as
so much land to be crossed in reaching places farther west.
But changing conditions in the states east of the Mississippi
River made people begin to look upon Kansas in a
different light. The country there was becoming thickly
settled and the people wanted the lands of the eastern
Indians.</p>

<p><strong>Removal of Eastern Indians to Kansas.</strong> Soon after the
Louisiana purchase was made people began to talk of an
Indian reserve, of a state set aside for the Indians, and it
was believed that these western prairies would be useful
for such a purpose. Nothing definite was done, however,
until 1825, when the National Government began the
“removal policy.” The eastern part of Kansas was occupied
by two tribes of Indians, the Kanzas, or Kaws as
they are often called, north of the Kansas River, and the
Osages south of it. In 1825 the National Government
made treaties with these two tribes. Under the provisions
of these treaties each tribe retained only a small part of its
territory, the rest being ceded to the Government. In
return, the Indians were to receive certain annual payments
and were to be supplied with cattle, hogs, and
farming implements. The Government was also to provide
them with blacksmiths and with teachers of agriculture.
With these two tribes restricted to their
 <a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a><span class="pageno">46</span>
reservations, a large part of eastern Kansas was left to be
apportioned into reservations for Indians from the East.
In 1830 Congress passed an
act setting aside an Indian
country, which included eastern
Kansas. Then the removal
policy was carried out.
Under this arrangement the
Government made treaties
with the various eastern tribes
by which they gave up their
lands in exchange for certain
tracts in the Indian country.
The Shawnees had come in
1825, and during the ten or
twelve years following 1830
about seventeen tribes were located on reservations in
Kansas. Among these were the Iowas, Sacs and Foxes,
Kickapoos, Delawares, Chippewas, Pottawatomies, Wyandottes,
and Miamis. By 1850 there was not a tribe left
east of the Mississippi River. The Indians had all been
moved to these western plains, and no white man could
settle on any of the reservations without the consent of
the Indians.</p>

<p><strong>Indians Removed from Kansas.</strong> According to the
treaties the Indians were promised their land “so long as
grass should grow or water run.” But it soon developed
that the white men wanted Kansas also. In 1854 we find
the tribes being again transferred, this time to the Indian
Territory, now Oklahoma, where the remnants of the
various tribes still remain.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></span></p>
<a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a><span class="pageno">47</span>

<p>Although Kansas was not used during those early years
to make homes for white settlers, a few hundred people
came here. They were of three different classes; fur traders,
missionaries, and soldiers.</p>

<p><strong>The Fur Traders.</strong> It is impossible to say when the first
hunters and trappers came to these western plains, for
they were generally obscure men and little was known of
their comings and goings, but they were the real pathfinders
of the West. There are records of fur traders here
in the very early years of the nineteenth century, and they
gradually went farther and farther into the vast wilderness.
The streams of travel across Kansas in the ’40’s
followed paths that had been pointed out by the fur
traders.</p>

<p>The fur companies established many trading posts,
which served as forts for protection against the Indians
and as places to which hunters and trappers could bring
 <a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a><span class="pageno">48</span>
their furs. Some of the hunters and trappers were employed
by the fur companies, and others worked independently.</p>

<p>Many Indians also engaged in this trade, and often
they were given
tobacco, whisky,
and weapons in exchange
for their furs.
In this way much of
the work of the missionaries
was undone.
In the earlier
years the hunters
and trappers found
many kinds of wild
animals in Kansas:
the buffalo, the wolf,
the fox, the deer,
the elk, and the antelope,
and along
the streams the
beaver, the otter,
the mink, and the
muskrat. Later
the main supply of
furs came from the mountains, and the whole fur trade
gradually moved west of what is now Kansas.</p>

<p><strong>Father Padilla, the First Missionary in Kansas.</strong> The
attempt to civilize the Indian began in the days of the
early explorers, and it was on Kansas soil that the first
missionary’s life was lost in the cause. This man was
Father Padilla, a Jesuit, who came with Coronado on his
journey to Quivira. Father Padilla became much interested
in the Quivira Indians and remained to do missionary
 <a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a><span class="pageno">49</span>
work among them. His preaching was of short duration,
however, for he was soon killed, whether by the Quiviras
or some other tribe is not known.</p>

<p><strong>Kansas Missionaries of the Nineteenth Century.</strong> Centuries
later, when Kansas became a part of the United
States and was explored and traversed by white men,
missionaries were among the first to arrive. They came
to instruct the Indians in the Christian religion and to
persuade them to adopt the customs of civilization.</p>

<p>Of the many who came, Rev. Isaac McCoy probably
deserves first mention. He had spent many years in work
among the Indians and strongly urged the removal policy.
He believed that if they could live in a separate state,
free from contact with the white race, the Indians could
be civilized, and he gave his life to this work.</p>

<p>Jotham Meeker and his wife were among the most
devoted of the missionaries, but there were many others,
both men and women, who placed the welfare of human
beings above mere gain and who endured the hardships
of life among the savages for the sake of the good they
might do.</p>

<p><strong>Missions Established.</strong> As soon as the eastern Indians
were removed to Kansas a number of missions were established
by Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, Friends, and
Catholic churches. The work of the missionaries was not
confined to religious instruction. Schools were established,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_8" id="fnanchor_8"></a><a href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></span>
books were printed, the Indian girls were taught
cooking and sewing, and the boys were taught farming
and such trades as blacksmithing and carpentry.</p>

<p>The most noted mission in Kansas was the one established
 <a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a><span class="pageno">50</span>
by the Methodist Church for the Shawnee Indians
near the present site of Kansas City. This mission was
opened in 1830 and continued its work for more than a
quarter of a century. It had a large tract of land and good
buildings, and maintained a successful school. Rev.
Thomas Johnson, who took a prominent part in early
Kansas affairs, was in charge of the mission.</p>

<p><strong>The Soldiers.</strong> The third class of people who came to
early Kansas was the soldiers. Their presence was
necessary for the protection of the few white people
against the Indians. Fort Leavenworth was established
by the National Government in 1827, as headquarters
for the troops. This was shortly after the beginning of
the Santa Fe trade. During the ’40’s this fort was used
as a base of supplies for the soldiers of the Mexican War,
 <a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a><span class="pageno">52</span>
and as an outfitting point for many of the California gold
seekers and Mormon emigrants. Fort Leavenworth is
to-day one of the most important of the national forts.
A number of other forts were established, among them
Fort Riley, Fort Dodge, Fort Scott, and Fort Hays, but
all of these have been abandoned except Fort Riley.</p>

<p><strong>Population of Pre-territorial Kansas.</strong> Kansas remained
in possession of the Indians until 1854, when it was organized
into a territory. With this date a new era began.
 <a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a><span class="pageno">53</span>
At this time the white population consisted of about
twelve hundred people, one half of them soldiers and the
other half connected with the trading posts and the missions.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">SUMMARY</p>

<p class="blockquote">When the country that is now Kansas became a part of
the United States it was occupied by four tribes of Indians.
In 1825 the Kanza and Osage tribes ceded a large part of
their lands to the Government and the eastern quarter of
the State was made a part of the Indian country by the
Act of 1830. Following this a number of eastern tribes
were removed to reservations in Kansas, where they remained
until Kansas was organized as a territory, in 1854,
when they were moved to Indian Territory, now Oklahoma.
During these years there was much travel through the
State, but up to 1854 the white population numbered only
about twelve hundred. These people were of three classes;
traders, missionaries, and soldiers.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">KANSAS ORGANIZED AS A TERRITORY</h4>

<p class="p2"><strong>The Year 1854 an Important Date.</strong> The year 1854 is an
important one in the history of Kansas, for it brings to a
close the period during which this region was used as a
hunting ground by the Indians and marks the beginning
of its use as a home for white people. The white settlers
did not come in peace and quiet; the first dozen years following
1854 were filled with hatred, struggle, and bloodshed.
This was brought about by conditions outside of
Kansas. As we have seen, twenty-five years earlier Kansas
was made an Indian territory because people in the
states wanted the lands of the eastern Indians. In 1854 a
terrible conflict began here because there was a division
between the North and the South on the question of
slavery.</p>

<p><strong>Attitude of the North and the South Toward Slavery.</strong>
Slavery had existed in the United States since very early
colonial days. It had not been profitable in the northern
states, but in the cotton fields of the southern plantations
slave labor was in demand, and its use after the invention
of the cotton gin had increased steadily with the passing
years. The Northerners had long been opposed to slavery
and made every effort to keep it from spreading into
northern and western territory, while the Southerners
were just as determined that it should flourish and that
it should be extended into new territory. This difference
between the North and the South developed great bitterness.
Neither side lost any opportunity to take advantage
of the other, and each was anxious to secure a majority in
the Senate in order to obtain favorable legislation. This
matter was so carefully watched that it had long been the
 <a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a><span class="pageno">57</span>
custom to keep the “balance of power” between the states;
that is, to admit free and slave states alternately so as to
keep the number of proslavery and free-state senators
balanced. The North, because of its more rapid growth
in population, had long had a majority in the House.</p>

<p><strong>The Missouri Compromise, 1820.</strong> Missouri was along
the dividing line between the North and the South, and
when it asked to be admitted to the Union there followed
a long debate in Congress as to whether it should come in
slave or free. The question was finally settled by the
Missouri Compromise, which provided that Missouri
might come in as a slave state but that all the rest of the
territory included in the Louisiana Purchase and lying
north of 36° 30′, the line forming the southern boundary
of Missouri, should be forever free. In other words,
slavery was to be forever excluded from Kansas and the
territory lying north of it.</p>

<p><strong>Slavery Trouble Brings on the Civil War.</strong> This was in
1820, about the time of the beginning of the Santa Fe
trade. During the years when Kansas was an Indian
country and was traversed by countless caravans the
country remained bound by the terms of this compromise.
But all this time the feeling of animosity between the
North and the South was growing more intense; northern
churches and newspapers denounced the evils of slavery,
free-state and abolition parties developed, thousands of
slaves were assisted in making their escape through the
North to Canada in spite of the strict fugitive slave law,
and there was bitter strife in Congress between the free-state
and the slave-state members. The relations between
the North and the South were becoming more and
more strained. The time was rapidly approaching when
the differences between the two sections were to be settled
by a great war.</p>
<a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a><span class="pageno">58</span>

<p><strong>The Conflict Brought into Kansas in 1854.</strong> The Civil
War began in 1861, the same year in which Kansas became
a state; but seven years earlier, in 1854, Congress
had passed a measure that brought the slavery trouble
into Kansas and made this state the battle ground in the
great national struggle over the slavery question.</p>

<p><strong>The Kansas-Nebraska Bill, 1854.</strong> The measure passed
by Congress that played such an important part in the
history of Kansas and of the Nation was known as the
Kansas-Nebraska Bill, and was the work of Senator
Stephen A. Douglas, of Illinois. It provided that the two
territories, Kansas and Nebraska, should be organized,
and that the question of slavery should be left for the
people of each territory to decide for themselves. This
method of settling the question was known as “popular
sovereignty.” Because the settlers were often called
squatters it was frequently called “squatter sovereignty.”</p>

<p><strong>Reception of the Bill.</strong> Kansas and Nebraska were part
of the territory which, according to the terms of the Missouri
Compromise, was to be forever free, but under the
Douglas bill they were to become either slave or free as
the people who settled the territories might decide. When
this bill was introduced into Congress it raised a storm of
indignation among those opposed to slavery, and the
debate which ensued lasted for months. The whole North
was aroused and poured forth objection and protest, but
to no avail. The bill was passed May 30, 1854.</p>

<p><strong>Result of the Bill.</strong> The Kansas-Nebraska Bill meant
that the Missouri Compromise had been repealed and
that there was no longer any boundary line against slavery.
It meant that Kansas and Nebraska were offered as prizes
to be contended for by the free and the slave states. The
South said, “You may have Nebraska; Kansas is ours.”
The North refused to recognize such a division of spoils,
 <a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a><span class="pageno">59</span>
and insisted that both territories had been carved from
free soil and should both come into the Union free. Both
North and South desired to secure Kansas, and each side
urged that as many as possible of its own people should
emigrate to the new Territory. It could scarcely be expected
that, under such circumstances, Kansas would be
left for gradual and peaceful settlement. The result was
that the scene of strife was transferred from Congress to
these western prairies, and from that time until the admission
of the Territory as a state the conflict between
the forces of freedom and slavery was waged here.</p>

<p><strong>Indians Removed from Kansas Lands.</strong> It must be remembered
that at this time Kansas was an Indian country;
that many of the eastern tribes had given up their lands
in exchange for lands here which had been promised to
them forever. Nevertheless, the Indians were removed
from Kansas, many of them at once and others more
leisurely. They were taken to what has since become
Oklahoma, where many of them still live. In this way
room was made for the white settlers to enter Kansas.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">SUMMARY</p>

<p class="blockquote">For many years there had been bitter feeling between
the North and the South on the slavery question. In 1820
the Missouri Compromise was passed. This measure provided
that all the Louisiana Purchase lying north of the
southern boundary of Missouri, except Missouri itself,
should be forever free. This agreement was observed
until the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill in 1854.
This bill provided that the settlers of each of these territories
should decide whether it was to be made slave or
free. Each side was determined to win Kansas, and as a
result the slavery struggle was brought here. In order
to make room for settlers the Indians were moved to
Indian Territory, now known as Oklahoma.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">THE COMING OF THE SETTLERS</h4>

<p class="p2"><strong>Little Known of Kansas in 1854.</strong> Kansas in 1854 was,
to most people, only a name, a part of the great desert in
the Far West, an Indian country. Many of those who
had crossed it in emigrating to California had been impressed
with the beauty and richness of the country and
had written back glowing accounts of it. Some of them
had returned from the coast, and were now numbered
among our early settlers. When its organization as a
territory brought it into such prominence, knowledge of
Kansas soon became more general.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages of the South.</strong> The people of the South
felt confident that they could make it a slave state, for
they had gained many victories in Congress, and the
President, Franklin Pierce, was in sympathy with them.
Moreover, they were closer to Kansas than were the
northern people, and the only state touching Kansas was
the slave state Missouri.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages of the North.</strong> The people of the North,
however, possessed one very important advantage. The
population of the South consisted largely of plantation
owners and their slaves, and it was not an easy matter
for these men to leave their property or to take it into a
new and untried country. On the other hand, the North
was a land of small farms and shops and many laborers.
Moreover, there was much foreign immigration into the
United States in those years, and since the employment of
slaves left no place in the South for white laborers, most
of the immigrants entered the northern states, and added
to the number of those who were ready and anxious to go
farther west. Consequently many more settlers came into
 <a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a><span class="pageno">63</span>
Kansas from the North than from the South, but the
Southerners tried to overcome this handicap in other ways.</p>

<p><strong>The Coming of the Missourians.</strong> The plan of the
South was to use Missouri as the stepping-stone to Kansas.
Immediately following the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska
Bill a number of Missourians came over into Kansas and
took as claims large tracts of the best lands, in some cases
not even waiting for the removal of the Indians. Settlers
who asked for claims were required to build houses and
to use the land for homes for a certain length of time.
While some of the Missourians met these requirements,
many of them did not come here to live. They notched
trees, or posted notices, or laid rails on the ground in the
shape of a house, or in some other way indicated their
claims, and returned to their homes in Missouri, coming
back only to vote or to fight when it seemed to them necessary.
While in Kansas, however, they held a meeting
at which it was resolved that: “We recognize slavery as
always existing in this Territory,” and, “We will afford
protection to no abolitionists as settlers of Kansas Territory.”</p>

<p><strong>Handicap to Northern Emigration.</strong> The free-state people
could not step over a boundary line and be in Kansas.
They lived a long way off, the trip out here was expensive,
and little was known of the new Territory. It was a land
without homes or towns, churches, schools, or newspapers,
and the Northerners knew that people would hesitate to
start to Kansas under all these difficulties.</p>

<p><strong>The New England Emigrant Aid Company.</strong> So it came
about that even while the Kansas-Nebraska Bill was pending
in Congress a Massachusetts man named Eli Thayer
had thought out a plan for assisting and encouraging the
people to undertake the long journey. His plan was to
form a company for the purpose of inducing and organizing
 <a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a><span class="pageno">64</span>
emigration to Kansas and reducing the expense and
hardship involved. This was not to be done as charity,
but was to be put on a business basis. Thayer aroused
public interest in his plan by constant writing and speaking,
and since the people were ready to listen to whatever
promised to aid in making Kansas a free state, money
enough was soon raised to organize a company, called the
New England Emigrant Aid Company. It gathered and
published information concerning the new country and
organized emigrants into large parties in order to make
the journey more pleasant, to reduce expense, and to
lessen danger. Competent guides were sent with the
parties. The company established schools, newspapers,
mills, hotels, and other improvements that tended to
lessen the hardships of the pioneers and to further the
development of the new Territory. Several similar organizations
were formed, but none of them was so well known
nor so efficient as the New England Emigrant Aid Company.</p>

<p><strong>Work of the Emigrant Aid Companies.</strong> Hundreds of
people came here under the management of these companies,
but probably the greatest service the companies
performed was that of giving an immense amount of
publicity and advertising to Kansas. Newspapers were
filled with descriptions of the loveliness, the fertility, and
the future greatness of the new Territory, and people were
urged to go to Kansas at once, both to secure the advantages
of the country and to help in saving it from slavery.
In this way interest and enthusiasm were aroused over
the whole North, but for every one who came in one of
the emigrant aid parties there were many who came independently,
especially from the states farther west than
New England&mdash;&#8203;Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and
Iowa.</p>
<a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a><span class="pageno">65</span>

<p><strong>Southern Organizations.</strong> The organizations in the
North aroused much bitter feeling in the South, and a
reward was offered for the capture of Eli Thayer. The
South soon formed organizations too, some of them being
known as Blue Lodges, Social Bands, and Sons of the
South.</p>

<p><strong>The Coming of the Free-state Settlers.</strong> As has been
stated, the Missourians came into Kansas immediately
after the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Bill on May 30,
but the free-state people were not far behind, for on the
first day of August, just two months later, the first party
of emigrants sent out by the New England Emigrant Aid
Company reached the Territory. Even these were not the
first free-state men to arrive; a few who had come independently
were already here.</p>

<p><strong>The First Party of Settlers.</strong> This first party consisted
of only twenty-nine men. It had been organized with
some difficulty, for coming to Kansas was looked upon as
a dangerous undertaking. Hundreds of people gathered
to bid these men farewell as they started on their long
journey to take part in the great conflict between freedom
and slavery. There were many who would not have been
surprised had the whole party been murdered on their
arrival in Kansas, but when nothing of the kind happened
others took courage and more parties soon followed.</p>

 <p class="caption"><span class="sc">Early Kansas City.</span></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>They Reach the Present Site of Lawrence.</strong> The pioneer
party reached <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis by railroad, where they boarded a
steamboat and came up the Missouri River to Kansas
City, then a town of only three or four hundred people.
There they purchased an ox team to transport their baggage,
and on Saturday evening set out on foot into Kansas.
By Tuesday noon they reached the present site of Lawrence,
where they pitched their tents on a big flat-topped
hill. To-day the great buildings of the University of
 <a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a><span class="pageno">67</span>
Kansas stand on this hill, which is still called Mount
Oread,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_9" id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></span> the name given it by this first party of pioneers.
The weather was extremely hot; a drouth had parched
the earth and prairie fires had destroyed the grass, but the
pioneers were not discouraged. They staked out claims
in the surrounding country and began preparations for
the future.</p>

<p><strong>The Second Party Arrives.</strong> In a short time the second
party arrived. It was under the direction of Dr. Charles
Robinson and Samuel C. Pomeroy, who were leaders in
the free-state cause during the whole Territorial struggle.
This party was much larger, and part of its members were
women and children. The town was now laid out, organized,
and named Lawrence.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_10" id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></span> On the arrival of this party
a boarding house was established by two of the women.
It was thus described by a writer of that time: “In the
open air, on some logs of wood, two rough boards were laid
across for a table, and on washtubs, kegs, and blocks the
boarders were seated around it.” A short time later a
hotel was opened. It was constructed by driving into the
ground two long rows of poles, which were brought together
at the top and the sides thatched with prairie grass. The
ends were made of cotton cloth, and the building resembled
the “stray roof of a huge warehouse.”</p>

<p><strong>Getting Ready for the First Winter.</strong> The people lived
in tents and houses of thatch through the summer and fall,
but in the meantime all were busy getting log cabins ready
for the winter. By the time winter had come a number of
things had been accomplished: a sawmill was running,
churches had been organized, two newspapers had been
 <a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a><span class="pageno">68</span>
established, and Lawrence had been granted a post office
with mail from Kansas City three times a week. The
population was about four hundred. Many of the cabins
still had cloth doors and were without floors, and altogether
the people had all they could do to take care of themselves
through the winter. When two more parties of emigrants
arrived at the beginning of winter the task became much
more difficult.</p>

<p><strong>The Actual Settlers’ Association.</strong> Besides the work of
building homes and developing the town, there was much
to occupy the minds of the pioneers. Missourians had
taken claims over much of the eastern part of the Territory.
While some proslavery settlers had come to make
homes, just as the free-state settlers had, most of those
who had taken claims were really living in Missouri.
When the first party came to Lawrence, the members
bought out the claims where they located their town;
later other claimants appeared, and there was much
trouble over the title to the land. The same kind of
trouble arose in regard to the land taken by many free-state
settlers outside of Lawrence. It became a common
occurrence for a Missourian to come over and lay claim to
some free-state man’s land and warn him to leave the
Territory. This caused the formation of the Actual Settlers’
Association, which helped to adjust such difficulties.</p>

 <p class="caption"><span class="sc">The First House in Topeka.</span></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>Other Towns.</strong> Lawrence was not the only place in the
Territory that was settled before the close of the first
winter. People were coming in from north, east, and
south, settling on claims and starting other towns. The
principal proslavery towns were Leavenworth, Atchison,
and Lecompton. Free-state towns were Lawrence, Topeka,
Osawatomie, and Manhattan. Leavenworth and
Atchison were both founded by people from Missouri, and,
since they were on the Missouri River, came to be outfitting
 <a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a><span class="pageno">69</span>
points for travelers over the California and Salt
Lake Trails. Lecompton, on the Kansas River, not far
from Lawrence, soon became the headquarters of the proslavery
people, and for several years was the Territorial
capital. Topeka was founded with the hope of its becoming
the capital of Kansas. Osawatomie soon became
an important free-state center. Manhattan, on the Kansas
River at the mouth of the Big Blue, was for the first few
months called Boston. On the arrival of a party of
seventy-five people from Cincinnati, Ohio, the name was
changed to Manhattan. This party made the entire trip
from Cincinnati to Manhattan by boat.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">SUMMARY</p>

<p class="blockquote">When Kansas Territory was organized little was known
of it, but, because it was wanted by both the North and
the South, knowledge of Kansas spread rapidly. The
 <a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a><span class="pageno">70</span>
South had the support of every branch of the National
Government and the added advantage that the only State
touching Kansas was proslavery. The advantage of the
North lay in the fact that it had a much larger number of
people who were free to move to a new country. The
proslavery Missourians came in at once and took claims.
A few free-state people came within a month, and in two
months the emigrant aid parties began to arrive. The
fact that many Missourians had staked out claims and
gone back home led to numerous claim disputes and
caused the organization of the Actual Settlers’ Association.
By the time winter had come four emigrant aid parties
had arrived at Lawrence, many settlers were living on
their claims, and several towns had been started by each
side.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">THE FIRST TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENT</h4>

<p class="p2"><strong>The Government of a Territory.</strong> When a territory is
organized it must be provided with a government. The
people in a territory may not elect their officers as in a
state; they may elect a legislature and a delegate to Congress,
but the governor, secretary, judges, and certain
other officers are appointed by the President.</p>

<p><strong>The First Territorial Governor.</strong> In October, 1854,
there arrived in Kansas the first Territorial Governor,
Andrew H. Reeder, who, although he was known to favor
slavery, was heartily welcomed by all the people. That
he might become familiar with conditions in the Territory,
Governor Reeder made a tour of inspection shortly after
his arrival. Although this was but little more than four
months after the opening of the Territory, he found a
number of settlements scattered over eastern Kansas.
Towns were springing up, and the prairies were dotted
with the tents and cabins of the pioneers. Several thousand
people had arrived by this time, some of them free-state
and some proslavery. The proslavery settlers had
brought a few slaves. There were also many Indians here,
for only a part of the tribes had as yet been removed.</p>

<p><strong>The First Election Called.</strong> On his return from his tour
of observation, which had included the most remote settlements,
as far west as Council Grove and Fort Riley, Governor
Reeder issued a proclamation for the first election
to be held in Kansas. The date was set for November 29,
at which time a delegate to Congress was to be chosen.</p>

<p><strong>Interest in the Election.</strong> The settlers were all busily
engaged in building cabins and otherwise providing for the
coming of winter, and since this election was not deemed
 <a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a><span class="pageno">73</span>
of much importance they took little interest in it. This
was not the case, however, with the Missourians, and at
this first election, under the leadership of their Senator,
D. R. Atchison, they gave an exhibition of the methods
by which they expected to control Kansas.</p>

<p><strong>Election Day, November 29, 1854.</strong> On the day before
election the Blue Lodge voters began to cross the border
into Kansas. They came well armed, and organized into
companies, each of which went to a polling place. They
came to vote, and they voted. There were so many of
them that they were able to outnumber the legal voters
in many of the precincts where they took possession of
the polls. Election judges who refused to accept their
votes were removed and judges of their own installed.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_11" id="fnanchor_11"></a><a href="#footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>The Result.</strong> Of course the proslavery delegate was
overwhelmingly elected. He would probably have been
elected had the Missourians stayed at home, for up to this
time a majority of the settlers outside of Lawrence favored
slavery. The result of this unfair election was to renew
the excitement in the North at such a working out of the
principle of “popular sovereignty.” But the free-state
pioneers were not to be discouraged. They continued,
during the winter, their home building, their preparations
for the spring cultivation, and the securing of titles to
their land.</p>

<p><strong>The Second Election, March 30, 1855.</strong> The first event
of importance in the new year was the taking of the census
of the Territory in the spring. It showed a total population
of 8601, about 3000 of whom were voters. A little
later a date was set for the election of a Territorial Legislature.
Since this body of men would make the laws for
 <a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a><span class="pageno">74</span>
the Territory, there was no lack of interest among the
settlers in this election. It was well understood that the
Missourians were expecting to vote again. Money was
being raised and men hired to march into Kansas on election
day. They came, fully five thousand of them, armed
with pistols, guns, and bowie-knives, and marched to the
different polling places. They did not pretend to be residents
of Kansas, but boasted that they were from Missouri.
They were disorderly and dangerous, and in many cases
drove the legal voters from the polls. Not more than half
of the 3000 rightful voters cast ballots in this election, but
the count showed that more than 6000 ballots were cast.</p>

<p><strong>The “Bogus Legislature.”</strong> The whole thing had been
so openly fraudulent that the free-state people demanded
that the Governor set aside this election and call a new
one. The Missourians threatened his life if this were done.
When the day came for deciding the question, the men
who had been fraudulently elected gathered in the Governor’s
office, armed and defiant. The Governor and a
number of his friends who were there to protect him were
also armed. Bitter discussion ensued, but there was no
fighting. Contests had not been filed against all of the
men elected. Governor Reeder decided to recognize the
election except where sufficient proof of fraud was shown.
In these cases he threw out the returns and ordered
another election. The proslavery men took no part in the
new election, and a number of free-state men were chosen
to the Legislature. When the Legislature met, the proslavery
majority promptly unseated these free-state members
and recognized the men first elected. This gave the
Territory an entirely proslavery legislature. It was called
by the free-state people the “Bogus Legislature.” The
proslavery leaders were B. F. Stringfellow and D. R.
Atchison, both of whom lived in Missouri but took an
 <a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a><span class="pageno">75</span>
active part in Kansas affairs. Senator Atchison said,
“We wish to make Kansas in all respects like Missouri.”
So they adopted the whole body of Missouri laws, and
added a series of slave laws that were probably the most
severe of any ever enacted in the United States.</p>

<p><strong>The First Legislature, at Pawnee, July, 1855.</strong> The
Governor chose Pawnee as the place where the Legislature
should meet. Pawnee was a new town on the Kansas
River, within the present bounds of the Fort Riley military
reservation. Since it was west of nearly all the settlements,
the members had to make long journeys to reach it.
Both because of the inconvenience of location and because
the proslavery members desired to be nearer the Missouri
border, the Legislature remained in session at Pawnee
only five days, just long enough to unseat the free-state
members and to pass an act removing the seat of government
temporarily to Shawnee Mission. All that remains
of Pawnee to-day is the old stone building that was erected
for a capitol.</p>

<p><strong>The Removal of Governor Reeder.</strong> Governor Reeder
had refused to accede to all the demands of the proslavery
people, and had fallen into disfavor with them. When
he refused to sign some of their measures they petitioned
the President for his removal, which soon followed.
Governor Reeder’s administration had lasted through less
than a year of these troublous times. In the summer of
1855, with the Territory little more than a year old, the
people were divided into two bitter factions, proslavery
and free-state, with the proslavery people congratulating
themselves upon being rid of a Governor they could not
control, upon having the support of the President, and
upon having a Legislature unanimously proslavery. Daniel
Woodson, the Territorial Secretary, who now became
 <a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a><span class="pageno">76</span>
Acting Governor, approved the acts of the proslavery
Legislature.</p>

<p><strong>Gloomy Outlook for the Free-state People.</strong> These were
dark days for the free-state people; they had no hand in
the Government and no recognition in the laws of the
Territory. They were denounced, misrepresented, and
ridiculed. To add to the gloom of the situation, the new
Territorial Governor, Wilson Shannon, at first entirely
ignored the existence of free-state citizens. No community
could obey the slave laws passed by the “Bogus
Legislature” without becoming proslavery. But the free-state
people had no intention of becoming proslavery;
they had no intention of giving up the struggle. They
found themselves confronted with the question of what
was to be done. It was a very grave situation.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">SUMMARY</p>

<p class="blockquote">The first Territorial Governor, Andrew H. Reeder,
arrived in October, 1854. After a tour of inspection, he
called an election to choose a Territorial delegate to Congress.
Although there were probably enough proslavery
settlers to carry the election, the Missourians, to make
sure, came over in force, and elected their candidate with
an overwhelming majority. Another election was called
in March to choose members of a Territorial Legislature.
The Missourians came again, and although the census had
shown but 3000 voters in Kansas there were twice that
number of ballots cast. On proof of fraud Governor
Reeder threw out the contested returns and free-state men
were elected, but when the Legislature met the proslavery
majority unseated them and recognized those first elected.
Pawnee was chosen by the Governor as the Territorial
capital, but after five days the Legislature adjourned to
Shawnee Mission. The measures passed were entirely in
the interest of slavery. Although Governor Reeder came
to Kansas favoring slavery, he did not approve of the
methods of the proslavery people. He was removed in
 <a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a><span class="pageno">77</span>
July, 1855. He was replaced by Wilson Shannon, who
was in full sympathy with slavery interests. Every condition
was unfavorable to the free-state people at this time.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">RIVAL GOVERNMENTS IN KANSAS</h4>

<p class="p2"><strong>The Free-state Plan.</strong> The free-state people decided to
ignore the proslavery government, and since they were
really made outlaws by the “Bogus Legislature” they
organized another government and sought the admission
of Kansas as a state. To accomplish this it was necessary
to draw up a state constitution, which must be approved
by the people of the Territory and by Congress.</p>

<p><strong>Free-state Leaders.</strong> A number of meetings were held
for the purpose of getting the free-state people interested
and willing to work together.
The leaders in these efforts
were Dr. Charles Robinson,
of Lawrence, ex-Governor
Reeder, who had come back
to Kansas as a tireless worker
in the free-state cause, and
James H. Lane, a man of
much experience, who had
recently come to Kansas. Lane
became one of the most radical
of free-state men and played
an important part in Kansas
affairs for many years.</p>

<p><strong>The Topeka Constitution, 1855.</strong> In the fall of 1855 a
convention was held at Topeka, and a state constitution
which said, “There shall be no slavery in this State,” was
drawn up. When a little later the Topeka Constitution
was submitted to a vote of the people it carried by an
immense majority. Only free-state people voted, of course,
for the proslavery people did not recognize any of these
 <a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a><span class="pageno">79</span>
acts as having any force. Later in the winter state officers
were elected under the Constitution, Dr. Charles Robinson
being made Governor and James H. Lane a United States
Senator. In the spring of 1856 the Constitution was sent
to Congress with a request that Kansas be admitted to
the Union, but the bill making Kansas a state failed to
pass.</p>

<p><strong>The Wakarusa War, 1855.</strong> These were not the only
events occurring in the Territory. It had become evident
early in the fall of 1855 that with the people divided into
these two groups, each governing itself and denying the
authority of the other, there would be a conflict. The
proslavery people had committed several outrages that
added to the irritation of the free-state people, but the
real trouble came with the murder of a free-state man.
This brought on what was called the Wakarusa War.</p>

<p><strong>The Beginning of the Trouble.</strong> A proslavery man
named Coleman shot and killed a young free-state man
named Dow. This occurred about ten miles south of
Lawrence. Coleman then fled to Westport, Missouri,
where he appealed for protection to a man named Jones,
who, although he lived in Missouri and was the postmaster
at Westport, had been appointed by the “Bogus Legislature”
as sheriff of Douglas County. Jones was a border
ruffian of the lowest and most dangerous type, and had
made himself obnoxious to the free-state people by his
leadership in the fraudulent elections.</p>

<p><strong>The Arrest of Branson.</strong> In the meantime a friend of
Coleman declared that his life was threatened by Jacob
Branson, an old man with whom young Dow had made
his home. Thereupon Sheriff Jones arrested Branson, but
a party of free-state men, indignant because of such high-handed
proceedings, rescued him and took him to Lawrence.</p>
<a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a><span class="pageno">80</span>

<p><strong>Proslavery Hatred of Lawrence.</strong> Of all the settlements
in Kansas, Lawrence was the most hated by the proslavery
people, for it was the hotbed of free-state principles and
the gathering place of those who scorned the Territorial
Legislature. There had come to be a general proslavery
conviction that nothing less than the destruction of this
town could bring them peace and safety.</p>

<p><strong>Sheriff Jones Gathers an Army.</strong> Lawrence had nothing
to do with any of this trouble with the sheriff, but when
the rescued Branson was taken there it gave the enemy
an excuse to threaten the destruction of the town. When
his prisoner was taken from him, Jones sent a call to Missouri
for help and asked Governor Shannon for three
thousand men to “carry out the laws.” The result was
that fifteen hundred Missourians assembled for the destruction
of Lawrence, and camped on the banks of the
Wakarusa River about three miles south of the town.</p>

<p><strong>Lawrence Prepares for Defense.</strong> Meanwhile, although
Branson and his rescuers had left Lawrence and there
was not a man in the town for whom Jones had a warrant,
his army continued to gather, and Lawrence prepared for
defense. The surrounding settlers came in and the six
hundred men built fortifications and drilled.</p>

<p><strong>End of the Wakarusa War.</strong> The army of Jones, “an
unwashed, braggart, volcanic multitude,” was living off
the surrounding country, rifling cabins and stealing horses
and cattle. The people of Lawrence were feeling the burden
of the siege also, for with the large number of those
who had come in from the outside their supplies were being
rapidly exhausted. Finally two men succeeded in getting
through the lines of the enemy and reaching the Governor,
who was being deceived about conditions. Governor
Shannon then came to Lawrence, and, learning how things
really were, took an active part in arranging a treaty between
 <a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a><span class="pageno">81</span>
the opposing forces, and, to the disgust and disappointment
of Sheriff Jones, dispersed the proslavery army.
Without battle or bloodshed, what has since been known
as the Wakarusa War was over.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">SUMMARY</p>

<p class="blockquote">Instead of submitting to the proslavery Territorial
Government, the free-state people decided to set up
another government. They held a convention at Topeka
and drew up a constitution prohibiting slavery. This
constitution was adopted by the free-state people of the
Territory, and then sent to Congress with a request that
Kansas be admitted to the Union. The bill failed to pass.
These rival governments within the Territory brought on
the Wakarusa War, the principal events of which were as
follows: Coleman shot Dow and fled to Jones, sheriff of
Douglas County, for protection. Jones arrested Dow’s
friend Branson, who was rescued by free-state men and
taken to Lawrence, the town most hated by the proslavery
people. Jones then gathered an army of Missourians for
the purpose of destroying Lawrence. While both sides
were preparing for the struggle, two free-state men succeeded
in reaching Governor Shannon, who came to
Lawrence, and, on learning the real condition, succeeded
in arranging a treaty of peace, and dispersed the proslavery
army.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">THE PERIOD OF VIOLENCE</h4>

<p class="p2"><strong>The Severe Winter of 1855&ndash;’56.</strong> The Wakarusa War
closed in December, 1855. This second winter proved to
be an exceedingly severe one, and many of the settlers were
not sufficiently protected against the sudden and intense
cold. Most of the houses were hastily constructed, one-room
log buildings, many of them with dirt floors, and
windows and doors of cotton cloth. The storms drifted
into these cabins through numberless chinks and cracks
in roof and walls. One of the pioneers, writing of that
winter, says: “At times, when the winds were bleakest,
we went to bed as the only escape from freezing. More
than once we awoke in the morning to find six inches of
snow in the cabin. To get up, to make one’s toilet under
such circumstances, was not a very comfortable performance.
Often we had little to eat; the wolf was never far
from our door during that hard winter of 1855&ndash;’56.”</p>

<p><strong>Preparations for Hostilities.</strong> The struggle of the pioneers
with the hardships of winter closed hostilities for a
while, but it soon became evident that the Missourians
were preparing more extensively than ever to invade
Kansas, destroy Lawrence, and drive the free-state people
from the Territory, or force them to recognize the proslavery
Territorial Government. The free-state people
began to gather stores and ammunition and to send calls
to the northern states for men and money to meet the
situation.</p>

<p><strong>The Sacking of Lawrence, May 21, 1856.</strong> A number of
minor conflicts occurred. Sheriff Jones was wounded, a
young free-state man named Barber was killed, and then
came the long feared attack upon Lawrence. From the
 <a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a><span class="pageno">85</span>
beginning the policy of the free-state people had been to
avoid conflict wherever possible. On this occasion they
made every attempt to conciliate and to pacify the attacking
force, but in vain. As the proslavery leaders rode
through the town they were invited to dinner by Mr. Eldridge,
the proprietor of the new $20,000 hotel built by the
Emigrant Aid Company. They accepted the invitation,
and in the afternoon the mob
completely demolished the
hotel. They threw the two
printing presses of the town
into the river, ransacked stores
and houses, taking whatever
they wanted, and before leaving
town burned Governor
Robinson’s home. The financial
loss to Lawrence and the
surrounding country was heavy.
Though the people had been
oppressed and outraged they
had not been conquered. By
offering no resistance they had
robbed the affair of any possible
justification in the eyes
of the world.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

 <p class="caption"><span class="sc">John Brown.</span></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>John Brown.</strong> There was one who bitterly opposed this
policy of nonresistance, who believed that the way to meet
the situation was to fight. This was John Brown, a tall,
gaunt, grizzled old man who had come to Kansas a few
weeks before the sacking of Lawrence. Five sons had
preceded him and had settled near Osawatomie. John
Brown came, not to aid his sons in their pioneer struggles,
nor to make a home for himself, but because it seemed to
him an opportunity to strike a blow at slavery. He hated
 <a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a><span class="pageno">86</span>
slavery with an intensity that knew no bounds, and he
gave all of his mind and energy to warfare against it.</p>

<p><strong>The Pottawatomie Massacre, May 24, 1856.</strong> The
sacking of Lawrence roused him to a high pitch of excitement.
He believed that this outrage should be avenged,
and determined to strike a blow, to return violence for
violence. With a party of seven or eight men, including
four of his sons, he made a night trip down Pottawatomie
Creek where a number of proslavery settlers lived. Five
of these settlers were called out of their houses and killed.</p>

<p><strong>Beginning of Four Months of Violence.</strong> This kind of
warfare was not in accordance with the plans or purposes
of the leaders of the free-state movement, and was not
approved by them. News of the awful affair spread
rapidly through the Territory and created wild excitement.
The Pottawatomie massacre was followed by a period of
nearly four months of violence on both sides.</p>

<p><strong>Both Sides Arm for War.</strong> A band of border ruffians
gathered to wreak vengeance on those who had taken the
lives of the proslavery settlers of Pottawatomie Creek.
The battle of Black Jack resulted, in which the border
ruffians were defeated by John Brown and his men. The
Missouri border hurriedly gathered more forces and
marched a well-armed body of men into Kansas. The
free-state men had been busy, too, and on June 5 the
Missourians were met by a band of armed free-state
Kansas settlers.</p>

<p><strong>Armies Dispersed by the Governor.</strong> This alarming
state of affairs aroused Governor Shannon and he at once
ordered both sides to disperse. The free-state army disbanded,
but the Missourians obeyed sullenly, and on their
way back to Missouri they committed a number of depredations,
and pillaged Osawatomie, which they hated because
it was the home of John Brown.</p>
<a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a><span class="pageno">87</span>

<p><strong>Free-state Help from Northern States.</strong> The North was
deeply stirred by the calamities endured by the free-state
people in Kansas. Although practically all of the free-state
newspapers here had been closed or destroyed, the
papers in the northern and eastern states were filled with
narrations of the hardships, robberies, and murders that
had befallen antislavery settlers in the Territory. The
Kansas troubles were discussed from the pulpit, and the
great preacher, Henry Ward Beecher, advised sending
rifles to Kansas and pledged his church for a definite
number. The men thus sent out armed with Bibles and
rifles were sometimes called “The Rifle Christians.”
Public meetings were addressed by men fresh from Kansas,
among them ex-Governor Reeder, S. N. Wood, and James
H. Lane. Much sympathy was aroused for the suffering
free-state settlers. Large sums of money were raised,
and companies of men were organized to take part in the
Territorial contest. The movement swept over the states
from Boston to the Northwest.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_12" id="fnanchor_12"></a><a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></span> “Societies of semi-military
cast, no less willing to furnish guns than groceries,
sprang up as if by magic, and overshadowed the earlier,
more pacific organizations.” As a result of these agitations
a stream of migration moved toward Kansas during
the spring and summer of 1856. Every party came prepared
for defense, and many brought with them a goodly
stock of provisions. One writer says of the immigrants,
“There were fewer women and children, less house-luggage,
fewer agricultural implements; more men, more
arms, more ammunition.”</p>
<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pageno">88</span>

<p><strong>Missouri River Closed to Free-state Immigration.</strong>
These activities of the North were viewed with alarm by
the proslavery leaders. They believed that this inflow of
free-state settlers must be checked or it would end all hope
of making Kansas a slave state. One of the most important
of the measures they adopted for this purpose
was the closing of the Missouri River to free-state immigration.
They overhauled the steamboats and seized
merchandise and arms that were being sent to free-state
people, and they arrested and turned back all travelers
whom they believed to be unfriendly to the South. All
overland immigrants received similar treatment as soon
as they touched Missouri soil.</p>

<p><strong>New Route to Kansas.</strong> Although this policy occasioned
the northern people considerable loss and much inconvenience,
it did not check the movement toward Kansas.
It simply meant that the immigrants came through Iowa
and Nebraska, entering Kansas from the north.</p>

<p>The Southerners also appealed to their people and
money was raised and men were sent to Kansas, but the
response was not to be compared with that of the North.</p>

<p><strong>A Condition of Lawlessness.</strong> While these things were
going on, Kansas was becoming more and more lawless.
It would be hard to say which side surpassed the other in
misdeeds. A number of free-state leaders, including Dr.
Robinson, were held at Lecompton during the summer as
prisoners on a charge of treason. The free-state people
were irritated by the loss of money, supplies, and mail,
through the Missouri blockade. Bands of armed proslavery
men guarded the roads out of Topeka and Lawrence,
so that these towns were really in a state of siege.
These guards lived on supplies taken from the surrounding
settlers, and cut off supplies sent to the towns so that food
became very scarce, especially at Lawrence, where the
 <a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a><span class="pageno">89</span>
chief article of diet for some time was ground oats. Meanwhile,
supplies were reaching the proslavery towns, Tecumseh,
Lecompton, and Franklin, without hindrance.
It was evident to the free-state people that their enemies
expected to starve them out of the Territory, and they
were stirred to retaliate. The free-state guerrillas again
began their work of seizing the supplies of proslavery
settlers and merchants. This was kept up until many of
the proslavery people were completely impoverished.</p>

<p><strong>The “Army of the North.”</strong> About the first of August
a report that Lane was coming with the “Army of the
North” spread over the Territory. James H. Lane was
one of the free-state men who had been in the northern
states, addressing meetings and raising men and money.
He was a very eloquent speaker and had influenced many
to come to Kansas. The “Army of the North” consisted
of several hundred men, women, and children, most of
whom had come to make homes for themselves. This
army was a combination of several parties that had united
to come into Kansas over the new route through Iowa and
Nebraska. Lane was with the party, but only a small
number were armed or had been gathered by him.</p>

<p><strong>A Proslavery Army Gathers.</strong> The proslavery leaders
began to rally their men along the border. The following
sentences are taken from one of the calls they published:
“Lane’s men have arrived! Civil war is begun! And we
call on all who are not prepared to see their friends butchered,
to be themselves driven from their homes, to rally
to the rescue.” A large number of men soon gathered on
the border, anxiously awaiting permission to move into
Kansas; but as Governor Shannon had dispersed the
Missouri army a few weeks earlier, he now refused to issue
orders for the new army to move into the Territory.</p>

<p><strong>Governor Shannon Resigns.</strong> About this time Governor
 <a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a><span class="pageno">90</span>
Shannon resigned. He had so displeased the proslavery
people that he was compelled to flee for his life under
cover of night. Daniel Woodson, Secretary of the Territory,
now became Acting Governor until the new Governor
should arrive. As he was in full sympathy with
proslavery interests he opened the Territory to the Missouri
invasion. Woodson’s power lasted only three weeks,
but they were the darkest days that Kansas had experienced.</p>

<p><strong>The Burning of Osawatomie.</strong> The proslavery army
moved into Kansas. The Pottawatomie massacre had
not been forgotten, and when this army reached Osawatomie,
“the headquarters of old Brown,” they attacked the
town. John Brown had only forty-one men, and so
thoroughly did the enemy do their work this time that
only four cabins escaped burning.</p>

<p><strong>Arrival of Governor Geary, September, 1856.</strong> At this
time the new Territorial Governor, John W. Geary, arrived.
Governor Geary described the situation that he
found on his arrival in the following words: “I reached
Kansas and entered upon the discharge of my official
duties in the most gloomy hour of her history. Desolation
and ruin reigned on every hand; homes and firesides were
deserted; the smoke of burning dwellings darkened the
atmosphere; women and children, driven from their habitations,
wandered over the prairies and among the woodlands,
or sought refuge even among the Indian tribes.
The highways were infested with numerous predatory
bands, and the towns were fortified and garrisoned by
armies of conflicting partisans, each excited almost to
frenzy, and determined upon mutual extermination. Such
was, without exaggeration, the condition of the Territory
at the period of my arrival.”</p>
<a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a><span class="pageno">91</span>

<p><strong>Conditions in the Territory.</strong> In the meantime the big
body of armed Missourians was moving forward and the
proslavery settlers were gathering in answer to a call that
closed with these words: “Then let every man who can
bear arms be off to the war again. Let it be the third and
last time. Let the watchword be, ‘Extermination, total
and complete,’” The free-state people were scattered,
unorganized, and but scantily supplied with arms and provisions,
and were therefore in no condition to meet such a
force. Fortunately, the new Governor, whose policy was
that of fair play, at once ordered all bodies of armed men
to disband.</p>

<p><strong>Preparations for the Defense of Lawrence.</strong> The Missourians,
however, continued to move toward Lawrence.
The Governor then took some United States troops and
went to Lawrence, which he found in an almost defenseless
condition. The town was poorly fortified, with few provisions
and not more than ten rounds of ammunition.
Even the women and children were armed. There were
not more than three hundred people, but there seemed
to be no thought of surrender. They would either repulse
the enemy or perish in the attempt. The arrival of the
Governor with United States soldiers brought unexpected
relief.</p>

<p><strong>End of the Reign of Violence, September, 1856.</strong> On
the morning of September 15, Governor Geary marched
out to the Missouri army encamped about three miles
from Lawrence, held a conference with the leaders, and
insisted that his orders for disbanding be obeyed. The
Missourians consented, and the force of twenty-seven
hundred well-equipped men went home. Thus ended the
four months’ reign of violence<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_13" id="fnanchor_13"></a><a href="#footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></span> that had begun with the
 <a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a><span class="pageno">92</span>
sacking of Lawrence in May. The threatened attack on
Lawrence was the last organized effort of the Missourians
to take Kansas by force. Both sides soon gave up their
plundering expeditions, travel became safer and property
more secure. For a time peace settled down over the Territory,
and Governor Geary, believing that order was
entirely restored to Kansas, appointed November 20 “as
a day of general praise and thanksgiving to Almighty
God.” With the close of the period of violence a little less
than two and a half years had passed since the organization
of Kansas as a territory in the spring of 1854.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">SUMMARY</p>

<p class="blockquote">Hostilities were renewed in the spring of 1856. The
Missourians prepared for invasion, and the free-state people
for defense. Several minor conflicts were followed by
the sacking of Lawrence, to which the free-state people
offered no resistance. This policy was not approved by
John Brown. He counseled revenge and the Pottawatomie
massacre followed. Then began a four months’ “reign of
terror.” Several conflicts followed, among them the battle
of Black Jack. An army was hurriedly gathered by each
side, but Governor Shannon ordered them to disperse.
The sympathy of the whole North was aroused, and men
and money poured into Kansas. This led to the closing
of Missouri to free-state travel, and the newcomers entered
Kansas through Nebraska. During this time both
sides were committing many outrages and there was a
constant condition of lawlessness. The coming of the
“Army of the North” resulted in the gathering of a large
army from Missouri called “the 2700.” Governor Shannon
resigned, and Acting Governor Woodson permitted
this army to enter Kansas, and it marched toward Lawrence,
pillaging Osawatomie as it passed. While Lawrence
was awaiting attack, Geary, the new Governor, arrived
and ordered the army disbanded. This ended the period
of violence.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">THE PERIOD OF POLITICAL CONTESTS</h4>

<p class="p2"><strong>Beginning of the Political Period, 1857.</strong> The Missourians
had given up hope of conquering Kansas by force.
After the close of the period of violence the contest became
almost entirely a political struggle between the proslavery
and the free-state settlers, each side trying to win
Kansas by securing control of its government. The next
few years were filled with conventions, elections, and
political schemes.</p>

<p><strong>Governor Geary Leaves the Territory.</strong> The second
Territorial Legislature met at Lecompton in the opening
days of 1857. Because of Governor Geary’s efforts to be
just to both sides, the Legislature did everything possible
to annoy and harass him. The free-state men rallied to
his support, but conditions soon became so intolerable
that one night in March, after having been in office about
six months, he made a hasty escape from Kansas. Governor
Geary had found Kansas in a deplorable condition
and left it not greatly improved, but he had attempted
to do justice to all. His place was taken by Governor
Walker, who arrived in May.</p>

<p><strong>A Proslavery Constitution Prepared, 1857.</strong> Up to this
time the only attempt to get Kansas admitted as a state
was the effort of the free-state men under the Topeka
Constitution, but the proslavery people had long been
planning to draw up a constitution under which they
might secure the admission of Kansas as a slave state.
The Territorial Legislature provided for a constitutional
convention, which met at Lecompton in September, 1857,
and prepared what was called the Lecompton Constitution.</p>
<a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a><span class="pageno">95</span>

<p><strong>The First Free-state Territorial Legislature.</strong> Two important
events were to take place in the fall of 1857: the
election of a new Territorial Legislature, and the vote on
the Lecompton Constitution. When election day came,
United States troops were stationed in the different precincts
to prevent illegal voting and invasions from Missouri.
Under Governor Walker’s promise of a fair election,
both parties voted for the first time since the fraudulent
election in the spring of 1855. The result was a free-state
victory, and the first time Kansas was to have a free-state
Legislature. This result was not achieved without many
protests and threats from the proslavery people, who now
became afraid to submit their Lecompton Constitution
to a vote, for it was clear that the free-state people were
largely in the majority and would defeat it.</p>

<p><strong>Fear to Submit the Lecompton Constitution.</strong> After a
number of meetings and debates among themselves, the
proslavery people decided to get around this difficulty by
not submitting the Constitution at all, but by offering instead
these two statements to choose between: “The
Constitution with slavery,” or “The Constitution without
slavery.”</p>

<p><strong>Each Side Holds an Election.</strong> This gave the free-state
people no chance to vote against the Constitution as a
whole, and of course their indignation was aroused. The
election was held in December, 1857. The free-state men
refused to vote, and after several meetings and a special
session of their new free-state Legislature the free-state
people appointed a day in January, 1858, for an election
to decide for or against the Constitution. This time the
proslavery party refused to vote. Thus each side held an
election and carried its point by a big majority.</p>

<p><strong>End of the Lecompton Constitution.</strong> No attention was
paid to the defeat of the Constitution at the hands of the
 <a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a><span class="pageno">96</span>
free-state people, and it was sent to Congress. After a
long discussion Congress attached a number of conditions
to the Constitution and sent it back to Kansas to be voted
on by all the people. Of the 13,000 votes cast at this
election, which was held August 2, 1858, more than 11,000
were against it. This ended the second attempt to get
Kansas admitted as a state.</p>

<p><strong>The Leavenworth Constitution, 1858.</strong> While the Lecompton
Constitution was pending in Congress, the free-state
people concluded that it was time for them to try
their hands at constitution making again. During the
winter and spring of 1858 they produced the Leavenworth
Constitution, but it was not favorably received by the
people of Kansas and was never voted on by either house
of Congress.</p>

<p><strong>Trouble in Southeastern Kansas.</strong> These events of
Territorial history occurred within a small area. With
Lawrence as a center, a circle with a radius of thirty
miles would include virtually all of them. Another part of
Kansas, the southeastern, including what is now Miami,
Linn and Bourbon counties, came into prominence at this
time and showed that the period of bloodshed was not yet
past. The southeastern part of the Territory had been settled
largely by proslavery people, but gradually the Northerners
began to come in. The proslavery people frequently
made raids on them, the free-state settlers retaliated, and
southern Kansas was soon in the midst of a guerrilla warfare.
The free-state people engaged in this warfare came
to be known as Jayhawkers.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_14" id="fnanchor_14"></a><a href="#footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></span> Their leader was a man

<a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a><span class="pageno">97</span>

<p><strong>The Marais des Cygnes Massacre.</strong> These conditions
continued until in the spring of 1858. While the Lecompton
and Leavenworth constitutions were being considered
in the Territory, there occurred in Linn County the Marais
des Cygnes massacre, the most shocking and bloody event
of the whole Territorial period. A Southerner named
Hamelton made up a list of free-state men whom he
planned to seize and execute. On May 19, almost two years
to the day after the Pottawatomie massacre by John
Brown, Hamelton with a gang of Missourians captured
eleven of the free-state men, marched them to a near-by
gulch, lined them up and fired a volley. Five men were
killed, five were wounded, and one remained unharmed.
This terrible deed created great excitement, and an unsuccessful
attempt was made to capture Hamelton and
his men.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_15" id="fnanchor_15"></a><a href="#footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Order Restored.</strong> Steps were taken to bring about a
more settled condition in southeastern Kansas. Though
several other outrages took place, none of them was so
barbarous as the Marais des Cygnes massacre, and order
was gradually restored.</p>

<p><strong>Proslavery and Free-state Names Dropped.</strong> During
the trouble over the Lecompton Constitution in the closing
days of 1857 Governor Walker was compelled to resign,
and in the autumn of 1858 Governor Denver, who succeeded
him, voluntarily resigned. Although Denver was
the fifth Territorial Governor, he was the first one who
had not been compelled to give up his office. This was
one of the indications that better days were beginning in
Kansas. Lawlessness was practically over. The South
was no longer hopeful of making Kansas a slave state.
The settlers dropped the terms proslavery and free-state,
 <a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a><span class="pageno">98</span>
and identified themselves with the National political
parties.</p>

<p><strong>The Wyandotte Constitution, 1859.</strong> In the summer of
the next year, 1859, a fourth constitutional convention
was held at Wyandotte. There was less hard feeling now
between the two factions, and the members of this convention
were from both political parties, Democrat and Republican.
It was generally conceded by this time that
Kansas was to be a free state, and the new Constitution
contained the words, “There shall be no slavery in this
State; and no involuntary servitude, except for crime,
whereof the party shall have been duly convicted.” This
was called the Wyandotte Constitution, and when it was
submitted to the people in the fall a large majority of the
votes were cast in favor of it.</p>

<p><strong>Kansas Admitted to the Union, January 29, 1861.</strong> But
the question was not yet settled, for Congress had to vote
on the admission of Kansas under the Wyandotte Constitution.
These events took place in the closing days of
1859, only a little more than a year before the beginning
of the Civil War. Relations between the North and the
South had become strained almost to the breaking point.
The Congressmen from the South had given up hope of
making Kansas a slave state, but they were certainly not
anxious to admit it as a free state, and consequently a
year passed before the Wyandotte Constitution of Kansas
was acted upon. Finally, in January, 1861, some of the
southern states seceded from the Union and their representatives
and senators withdrew from Congress, leaving
a free-state majority. The bill for the admission of Kansas
under the Wyandotte Constitution was at once called up
and passed. The next day it was signed by President
Buchanan, and on January 29, 1861, Kansas became a
state.</p>
<a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a><span class="pageno">99</span>

<p><strong>First State Officers.</strong> In December, 1859, shortly after
the people had voted to adopt the Wyandotte Constitution,
they held an election to choose state officers to act
whenever Kansas should be admitted to the Union. For
Governor they chose Dr. Charles Robinson, who had so
faithfully served the free-state cause throughout the long
but successful struggle. The first United States senators
from Kansas were two other well-known free-state men,
James H. Lane and Samuel C. Pomeroy. The Wyandotte
Constitution designated Topeka as the temporary capital.
An election was held in November, 1861, for the purpose
of selecting a permanent capital. Topeka received 7996
votes, Lawrence 5291, and all other places 1184. Thus
Topeka became the capital of Kansas.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">SUMMARY</p>

<p class="blockquote">The first two and a half years of the Territorial period
were spent in the warfare which was practically closed
when Governor Geary sent “the 2700” home. The last
four months of the two and a half years formed the
“period of violence.” The next three years were given to
the political struggle which ended with the adoption of the
Wyandotte Constitution. During the remaining year the
people went about their work, while this Constitution was
pending in Congress. In 1857, early in the political period,
the free-state people succeeded, for the first time, in electing
the Legislature. The proslavery people prepared the
Lecompton Constitution, but submitted to the people
only two statements concerning it. The free-state people
refused to vote, but held another election, at which the
proslavery people refused to vote. After the Lecompton
Constitution was returned from Congress it was voted on
by both factions and defeated. In the meantime the free-state
people submitted the Leavenworth Constitution,
which was defeated. During the last six months of the
political period the Wyandotte Constitution was prepared,
adopted, and sent to Congress. This was in 1859. More
 <a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a><span class="pageno">100</span>
than a year passed before Congress acted on the matter;
then, January 29, 1861, Kansas became a state.</p>

<p class="p2"><strong>Comforts of Life Receive Little Attention.</strong> The seven
Territorial years had brought freedom to Kansas, but the
struggle had left the pioneers little time or strength for
building better homes, improving their farms, or establishing
public institutions. The energy that might have
accomplished these things had been given to fighting and
to politics. When Kansas became a State, the people had
almost as few of the comforts of life as when they first
came to the Territory. A few of them had come with
little idea of the hardships and privations of frontier life,
and others had believed that such conditions would last
 <a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a><span class="pageno">103</span>
but a short time. Many of these, of course, grew discouraged
and returned to their eastern homes. But the
great body of Kansas pioneers had come with the twofold
purpose of securing homes and making a free state, and
were not to be discouraged. They had come to stay.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>Conditions of Living During the ’50’s.</strong> Frontier life is
always hard, but it was made many times harder in Kansas
by the years of strife and warfare. The inconveniences
and hardships were especially severe outside the towns.
In these days of railways and good roads, of the telegraph
and the telephone, it is difficult to realize what life on the
prairies meant in the ’50’s. Post offices and mail routes
came slowly, and for many of the settlers a trip for mail
and provisions meant a journey of two or three days, or
even longer, with an ox team. Neighbors were often many
miles apart. Nearly every one’s supply of farming implements
 <a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a><span class="pageno">104</span>
was scanty, and to replace a broken ax might require
a trip of from twenty-five to fifty miles. In the
winter these journeys were often accompanied with danger
and suffering. Streams were without bridges and many
of the fords were deep and treacherous. Fences were few
and roads were mere trails over the prairies, so when the
blizzard swept across the country, piling its drifts of snow
and obliterating every landmark, the unfortunate traveler
was in great danger of losing his way. Getting a farm
under cultivation was slow work at best. Since most of
the settlers brought but little money with them they had
to trust to raising a crop, and if sickness or drouth or raids
made it impossible to raise the crop, want and suffering
followed.</p>

<p>The privations, the sacrifices, and the loneliness of
pioneer life fell most heavily on the women. Business and
necessity brought the men together occasionally, but the
pioneer woman in the isolation of her prairie home often
saw no friendly face for months at a time. There was
much sickness and death, especially among women and
children, resulting from the combination of poor food,
uncomfortable houses, homesickness, and excitement arising
from the many dangers. The cost of transportation
was so great that only the most necessary articles were
brought from the East. Most furniture was home-made
and cooking was done over an open fireplace. Corn bread
and bacon with occasional game and wild fruits were the
usual foods. In wet seasons there was much fever and
ague. Sometimes a whole family would be sick at the
same time, with no neighbors near enough to help and no
physician within many miles.</p>

<p><strong>The Drouth of 1859-’60.</strong> Each year during the Territorial
period the crops raised were barely sufficient to
keep the people through the winter. There was no surplus
 <a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a><span class="pageno">105</span>
at any time, and when the summer of 1859 brought a
drouth, a famine resulted. Through all the hard struggle
the people had believed that as soon as the strife and
political difficulties were over, prosperity would come.
However, with the dawning of peace in the Territory there
came the most severe drouth that has ever been known in
the West. It began in June, 1859, and from that time
until November, 1860, a period of more than sixteen
months, not enough rain fell at any one time to wet the
earth to a depth of more than two inches. Two light
snows fell during the winter, but neither was heavy enough
to cover the ground. The ground became so dry that it
broke open in great cracks, wells and springs went dry,
and the crops were a total failure.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

 alt="Illustration: Sod House"

 <p class="caption"><span class="sc">A Sod House.</span></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>Effect of the Drouth on Kansas Settlers.</strong> There were
at this time nearly 100,000 people in Kansas, and to fully
 <a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a><span class="pageno">106</span>
60,000 of them the drouth finally meant that they must
receive help or starve. They had been able to fight border
ruffians, but they could not fight starvation. After a year
of the drouth they began to give up and go back East.
During the fall of 1860 no fewer than 30,000 settlers
abandoned their claims and the improvements that had
been made at the expense of so much labor, and left
Kansas. There were still 30,000 people here for whom
charity was necessary. All this brought bitter disappointment
to the people who had come to Kansas with
high hopes and willing hands.</p>

<p><strong>Aid Sent from the East.</strong> As soon as the true condition
of affairs was known in the East a movement was begun
for the relief of the sufferers. Many states responded liberally,
and immense quantities of provisions and clothes
were sent here to be distributed. Hundreds of bushels of
seed wheat were furnished. Besides all of the public help,
many relatives and friends sent supplies to the pioneers.
Nevertheless, there were many that winter who barely
escaped starvation.</p>

<p><strong>Drouth Retards Development of Kansas.</strong> Great as
was the suffering from disappointment and want, the
drouth brought another evil; it threw Kansas back in its
development. Not only had a third of the population
left the Territory, but the accounts given by those who
returned tended to discourage others from coming. The
old stories about the “Great American Desert” were revived.
Kansas was looked upon as a place of drouth and
famine, and for several years the number of immigrants
was much decreased.</p>

<p><strong>Statehood Begins.</strong> All this was taking place while the
Wyandotte Constitution was being considered. Kansas
was admitted as a State on January 29, 1861, at the close
of the terrible drouth. Through the winter and spring of
 <a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a><span class="pageno">107</span>
1861 supplies continued to come in from other states, and
included seeds for the spring planting. An excellent season
followed. It might be thought that at last the Kansas
settlers were to have an opportunity to cultivate their
farms, build homes, and make their new State a place of
peace and prosperity. But not so; Kansas was again to
suffer from the troubles of the Nation. The opening of the
Civil War was near.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">SUMMARY</p>

<p class="blockquote">The fighting and political strife of the Territorial period
left the people little opportunity for building up the
country. Statehood found frontier life but little improved.
The early settlers came to secure homes and to make
Kansas a free state, and were not easily discouraged. The
drouth of 1859-’60 caused nearly a third of the 100,000
Kansas settlers to leave the Territory, and another third
had to be given aid from the East. Immigration to Kansas
was greatly decreased for a time. A good crop year followed,
but Kansas had yet to pass through the Civil War
before it could enjoy peace.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">KANSAS IN THE CIVIL WAR</h4>

<p class="p2"><strong>Beginning of the Civil War.</strong> Just before Kansas was
admitted several of the southern states seceded from the
Union. The trouble between the North and the South
had reached the point where it could no longer be compromised.
Other states seceded, and when, on April 12,
1861, Fort Sumter was fired upon, the Civil War had
begun.</p>

<p><strong>Part Taken by Kansas in the Civil War.</strong> A state that
had just passed through nearly seven years of Territorial
struggle closing with a famine would hardly be expected
to take an active part in a great war, but the Kansas people
had been battling over the slavery question, and, being
deeply interested in the outcome, were ready to take up
arms in defense of the principle of freedom. Every call
for soldiers to defend the Union was liberally responded
to in Kansas. This State furnished more soldiers in proportion
to its population than did any other State. During
the four years of the war Kansas furnished a few more than
twenty thousand men, nearly four thousand more than
were asked for, and all of them were volunteers. The
poverty in the Kansas homes made it especially hard for
families to be left unprovided for, and as much honor is
due the women who stayed at home to work as is due the
men who marched away to fight. The Kansas soldiers
did duty on many battle-fields, and so conducted themselves
as to bring much credit to their State. During the
war Kansas was exposed to three lines of danger; invasions
by the regular Confederate army, attacks by the unorganized
border troops, and Indian raids on the frontier.</p>

<p><strong>The Quantrill Raid, August 21, 1863.</strong> For Kansas people
the Civil War meant a continuation of the border
troubles. Gangs of ruffians plundered and destroyed
property, and frequently committed worse crimes. These
acts reached a climax in the destruction of Lawrence on
August 21, 1863. The raid on Lawrence was led by Quantrill,
a border ruffian who had taken an active part in the
guerrilla warfare, and who with his men had sacked several
smaller towns along the border. With about four hundred
and fifty mounted men Quantrill crossed the border in the
late afternoon of August 20, and proceeded toward Lawrence.
Just before sunrise the raiders reached a hill only
a mile from the town. It is strange that they could have
made the ride of forty miles through Kansas settlements
without a word of warning reaching Lawrence, but such
was the case. When Quantrill and his men halted within
pistol shot of the houses of Lawrence to plan their attack,
the people suspected no danger. There was no armed
organization within the city, and all firearms were locked
in the arsenal.</p>

<p>The attack began with a wild charge on the town.
Horsemen rode through the streets at top speed, shooting
in every direction. Then they divided into small gangs
and scattered over the town under orders to “burn every
house and kill every man.” The horror of what followed
has seldom been equaled in the warfare of civilized people.
When the people of Lawrence realized that their town
was in the possession of Quantrill’s band they expected
that it would be burned and a few prominent citizens
killed, but wholesale murder was not looked for, and many
who might have escaped remained and were killed. For
four hours the ruffians robbed buildings, shot the occupants,
and applied the torch. Every house was a scene of
brutality or of remarkable escape. When the work of
 <a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a><span class="pageno">112</span>
butchery and destruction was finished, Quantrill and his
men retreated toward Missouri, mounted on stolen horses
and heavily laden with plunder. They kept up their work
of destruction by burning farmhouses as they passed. A
few troops followed them, but the raiders escaped across
the border.</p>

<p><strong>Loss from the Raid.</strong> The number of lives lost can never
be known with certainty, but it was about one hundred
and fifty. Many were seriously wounded. The loss of
property was variously estimated from one to two million
dollars. The work of rebuilding the town was immediately
begun, and with all their poverty the people of the State
gave generously to the stricken citizens of Lawrence.</p>

<p><strong>General Price Threatens Kansas.</strong> Kansas was too far
away from the center of conflict of the Civil War to become
the scene of great battles, but it was from time to
time threatened with invasion by the regular Confederate
army. During the last year of the war, General Price,
with a large Confederate force, marched northward
through Arkansas into Missouri. When it was reported
that he was moving westward, Kansas issued a call for
more soldiers. The response was immediate. More than
16,000 men appeared for service. A force of Kansas
troops marched into Missouri and met Price’s army in
battle at Lexington. As the armies moved westward
other battles were fought at the Little Blue and at the
Big Blue, and again at Kansas City and Westport, after
which Price was forced to retreat southward. He was
followed by the Union army. He crossed into Kansas
in Linn County, and skirmishes took place at Trading
Post Ford, at the Mounds, and at Mine Creek. Price
was then forced into Missouri again, where he was soon
defeated.</p>

<p><strong>End of the Civil War, 1865.</strong> In April, 1865, the great
war came to a close, after lasting almost exactly four years.
The questions of slavery and disunion were finally settled.
The whole nation was thankful to lay down its arms and
go back home, “to drop the sword and grasp the plow,”
but this was especially true of Kansas, where the people
had been doing battle over the slavery question for eleven
years. The Territorial period and the Civil War period
made one continuous conflict. With the heavy drain on
resources and population, it was not to be expected that
Kansas would make much growth or progress during the
Civil War. Development could little more than equal
waste and loss. The population of Kansas numbered
about 100,000 at the beginning of the war, and about
136,000 at the close. There had been little improvement
in the manner of living during the four years.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">SUMMARY</p>

<p class="blockquote">The Civil War began within three months after Kansas
became a state. Although Kansas had had no opportunity
to recover from the Territorial struggle, it took an active
 <a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a><span class="pageno">114</span>
part in the war. General Price threatened to invade Kansas
with a large Confederate force, but did not succeed.
The Indians committed depredations on the western
frontier. The worst feature of the war was the border
trouble, of which the Quantrill raid was the climax. During
the four years of the Civil War Kansas did not make a
large gain in population or in progress.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">KANSAS SINCE THE CIVIL WAR</h4>

<p class="p2"><strong>Beginning of this Period.</strong> Nearly three score years
have passed since the close of the Civil War; a
period of work, growth, and progress. The earlier years
in Kansas were but a time of preparation, and with the
end of the war the people were at last free to turn their
attention to farming or to other occupations. Hundreds
of new settlers poured into the State each year. Little
pioneer homes dotted the eastern part of the State more
and more thickly and the line of settlement moved rapidly
westward.</p>

<p><strong>Indian Troubles on the Frontier.</strong> As the white-topped
wagons of the immigrants became more numerous the
Indian and the buffalo were pushed farther on. But the
red man did not give up his hunting ground without a
struggle. The encroachments of the settlers had long been
resented. Even before the close of the Civil War, while
the soldiers were needed elsewhere, the Indians had begun
their depredations on the frontier. In 1865 and 1866
settlements were attacked in Republic and Cloud counties,
stock was driven away, much property was destroyed, and
a number of people were killed. The few settlers on their
scattered claims were poorly armed, and, with no soldiers
near to protect them, they were in constant fear of wandering
tribes of hostile Indians.</p>

 <p class="blockquote smaller">It has long been customary for each nation to have a great seal.
The United States has one, as has also each of the states. A seal
is used to make an impression on a document as a sign of its
genuineness. The design for the Great Seal of Kansas was adopted
by the first State Legislature. The thirty-four stars represent
the thirty-four states comprising the Union at that time. The
scene is supposed to typify the settlement and growth of the
State. The motto “_Ad astra per aspera_,” meaning “To the stars
through difficulties,” is peculiarly descriptive of the state’s
history.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>Open War with the Indians.</strong> The next year United
States troops were sent to protect the frontier. They
drove the Indians back and destroyed one of their villages.
This only made the red men eager for revenge, and they
began an open war on all settlers, immigrant trains,
traders, and travelers. Robberies and murders were committed
 <a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a><span class="pageno">117</span>
along the whole frontier, particularly in the Republican,
Solomon, and Smoky Hill valleys, and in Marion,
Butler and Greenwood counties. Travel over the Santa
Fe and other westward trails almost ceased and the line
of settlement was pushed eastward many miles. Many
tribes engaged in these attacks. They dashed into the
State from north or south or west, committed their cruelties,
and were gone.</p>

<p><strong>The Broken Treaty.</strong> At one time the Government
made a treaty with several tribes by which they were
removed to a reservation in the Indian Territory, but
were to have the privilege of hunting in Kansas as far
north as the Arkansas River, and were also to be provided
with arms. They kept their promise of peace only until
they could get ready for another attack, and while part
of them were being supplied with arms at one of the forts
the rest were engaged in a most heartless and bloody raid
on the northwestern settlements.</p>

<p><strong>The Indians Subdued.</strong> This led Governor Crawford
to organize several companies of Kansas volunteers and
to ask for more United States soldiers. Later a regiment
of Kansas volunteer cavalry was called for, and on November
4, 1868, Governor Crawford resigned his office to
take command of this, the Nineteenth Regiment. After
considerable fighting the Indians were finally subdued,
and by 1870 the trouble was practically ended. There
were a few outbreaks from time to time, but none of them
was very serious. During this contest, which had lasted
from 1864 to 1869, the lives of more than a thousand
Kansas settlers had been lost, a great deal of property had
been destroyed, and the westward movement of settlement
had been greatly retarded.</p>

<p><strong>The Homestead Law, 1862.</strong> Shortly after the admission
of Kansas to the Union, Congress passed a measure that
 <a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a><span class="pageno">118</span>
had a wonderful effect on the growth of the State. This
measure was the Homestead Law, passed in 1862. This
law provides that any person who is the head of a family,
or who is twenty-one years of age, and who is a citizen of
the United States or has declared his intention to become
such, may acquire a tract of one hundred and sixty acres
of public land on condition of settlement, cultivation, and
occupancy as a home for a period of five years, and on
payment of certain moderate fees. It also provides that
the time that any settler has served in the army or navy
may be deducted from the five years. Previous to 1862
settlers bought their claims of the Government. The
liberal provisions of the Homestead Law attracted thousands
of settlers to Kansas. Many of the newcomers were
 <a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a><span class="pageno">119</span>
young men who had been in the army.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_16" id="fnanchor_16"></a><a href="#footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></span> Many of them
were foreigners newly arrived in America, while thousands
of others came from the eastern or central states. Nearly
all of them were poor. Many had scarcely enough to provide
for themselves until the harvesting of their first crop.
But they were full of hope and ambition, and were willing
to undertake the toil and privations of pioneer life for the
chance to make real their dreams of a home on the Kansas
prairies.</p>

<p><strong>Many Drouths in the Early Years.</strong> The task of turning
the bare plains into fertile fields was a heavy one, and the
brave people who began it endured many hardships and
met many discouragements and disappointments. Severe
 <a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a><span class="pageno">121</span>
drouths were of frequent occurrence in the early days, and
hot winds often swept across the country. The year 1869
was dry, with a partial failure of crops, and in 1874 came
a long dry spell, followed in the late summer by a scourge
of grasshoppers.</p>

<p><strong>The Grasshopper Invasion, 1874.</strong> At different times
there had been invasions of grasshoppers in the country
west of the Mississippi River, but none of them was so
disastrous as the one of 1874. The grasshoppers, which
were a kind of locust, came into the State from the northwest
and moved toward the southeast. The air was filled
with them. They covered the fields and trees and destroyed
everything green as they went. They left ruin
and desolation in their pathway. In the western counties,
where the settlements were new and the people had no
crops laid by to depend upon, the result was much like
that of the terrible years of 1859 and 1860. By the time
of the invasion there were more people, more provisions,
and more money, and the State was able to do much
to help the thousands of its citizens who were left destitute.
It became necessary, however, to accept aid from
the East again, and thousands of dollars and many carloads
of supplies were distributed to the needy. Never
since has Kansas had to ask for help. In more recent
years our State has given generously to sufferers in other
states and in other lands.</p>

<p>This visit of the grasshoppers was prolonged into the
next year, for they had deposited their eggs in the ground
and the next spring large numbers of young grasshoppers
hatched. These destroyed the early crops, but for some
unaccountable reason they soon rose into the air and flew
back toward the northwest whence the swarms of the
year before had come. There was still time for late planting,
and the crops of 1875 were abundant.</p>
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pageno">122</span>

<p><strong>Prosperous Years Follow the Grasshopper Invasion.</strong>
The coming of the grasshoppers had temporarily discouraged
immigration, but prosperous years followed and
people were again attracted to Kansas. More of the
prairie was turned into farms; new towns sprang up; the
country came to be more thickly settled; railroads, schools,
and churches were built; new counties were organized;
and the old stories of “The Great American Desert” were
gradually forgotten. Kansas was taking her place among
the states.</p>

<p><strong>Life of the Early Settlers.</strong> In order that this great
result might be accomplished, that the Kansas of to-day
might be, a generation of men and women had to conquer
these vast prairies that were swept by blizzards, parched
by drouths, scorched by hot winds, and scourged by grasshoppers.
A few of the pioneers gave up and returned to
their old homes, but most of them were of the sturdy type
and remained, always believing that the day of better
things was to come. Though they had little money and
few of the comforts and conveniences of life, and though
they were often filled with homesickness for the friends
and scenes they had left behind, they stayed and worked
and hoped. Volumes could be filled with stories of the
hardships and sorrows of those brave people; stories of
mothers who died from overwork or exposure or lack of
care, of children who sickened from want of proper food,
of homes swept away by prairie fires, and of homesteads
mortgaged and lost.</p>

<p><strong>The Pleasures of Pioneer Life.</strong> But this is only one
side. Pioneer life was not all dark. Most of the people
were strong and healthy, and the out-door life with plenty
of exercise and simple food kept them so. Although there
was privation and hard work there was also much pleasure.
Ask any old settler whether the people had good times in
 <a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a><span class="pageno">123</span>
those days, and you will hear tales of spelling schools and
of singing schools, of literary societies at which debating
was an important feature, and of the country dance with
its old-time music on the fiddle. These affairs were attended
by young and old from miles around; a trip of from
ten to fifteen or even twenty miles was not unusual. Buggies
were scarce, and most of the settlers went on horseback,
or in farm wagons that did not always have spring seats.</p>

<p>Quilting and husking bees, house-warmings, and camp
meetings were other events of the early days. Since there
were no telephones and since it was often days from one
mail to another, pioneer families counted it a pleasure to
“visit around” and exchange the news. Those were the
days of real hospitality; the “latch-string hung out at
every door,” and all were welcome to enter. No house
was too small nor no food supply too scanty for the entertainment
of friends or wayfarers. Those were the days,
too, when the children often waited for “second table” or
stood up to eat because there were not enough chairs for
all; when the boys wore high-topped boots, the girls wore
sunbonnets, and a calico dress was good enough for almost
any occasion.</p>

<p><strong>Buffalo Hunting.</strong> In the earlier years the buffalo hunt
was one of the pleasures of the pioneers. In the fall parties
of men with their teams and hunting outfits would set out
for the buffalo range to secure a supply of meat for the
winter. They were usually successful in finding not only
buffaloes, but antelopes, wild turkeys, and occasionally elk
or deer.</p>

<p><strong>Extermination of the Buffalo.</strong> Remarkable stories are
told of the great numbers of buffaloes still roaming our
western prairies fifty years ago; stories of herds miles in
width moving across the country. With the inrushing
tide of immigration the buffaloes rapidly disappeared.
 <a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a><span class="pageno">124</span>
Within little more than a dozen years after the close of
the Civil War there were practically none left. This was
not because they were used as food, but because they were
killed for their hides. Large numbers were slaughtered
and skinned and the bodies left on the plains. The hides
were shipped east by carloads, where they were sold to
make robes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

 <p class="caption"><span class="sc">Pile of Buffalo Hides Ready for Shipment.</span></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>Selling Buffalo Bones.</strong> In a few years the prairies were
thickly strewn with bleaching bones, and these, too, were
gathered up and shipped east, where they were ground
into fertilizer to be used on worn-out farms. These bones
brought from six to ten dollars a ton, and money earned
in this way served to tide many a homesteader through the
winter. It has often been regretted that the Government
did not take measures to restrict the killing of the buffalo,
but the danger of extermination was not realized until
too late.</p>
<a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a><span class="pageno">125</span>

<p><strong>The Trappers.</strong> A great deal of trapping was done, especially
by the younger men. Often several of them would
make up a party, and with guns, traps, and a winter’s supply
of provisions start for a favorite trapping ground,
where they would
make a camp
along some
stream. Sometimes
the camp
was a tent, but
more often it was
a dugout in the
bank with the
front part made
of logs. Along the streams they caught chiefly the beaver,
the otter, the raccoon, and the wildcat, and on the prairies
the big gray wolf and the coyote. The busy days
were filled with the work of visiting the traps, caring for
the pelts, chasing wild game, and keeping an alert watch
for Indians. When spring came and they turned homeward
to take up the work on the farms they often carried
with them several hundred dollars’ worth of furs.</p>

<p><strong>The Exodus, 1878-1880.</strong> The population of Kansas was
gradually built up from many sources, but until 1878 there
were not many negroes in the State. In that year there
began in some of the southern states a movement among
the colored people to migrate to western and northern
states. So many thousands of them left the Southland
that the movement came to be called “The Exodus.” It
is not strange that the State famed for its fight for freedom
should attract many of the ex-slaves, or the “Exodusters,”
as they were called. During the years 1878-’80 several
thousands of negroes arrived in Kansas. A few had teams
and some farm implements, some had a scanty supply of
 <a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a><span class="pageno">127</span>
household goods, but many had nothing at all and had to
be given aid. A very few of them homesteaded land,
others found employment as farm hands, and the rest
settled in different towns of the State.</p>

<p><strong>The Kansas Boom in the ’80’s.</strong> The ten years following
the grasshopper invasion of 1874 were all good years. The
rains fell and crops flourished. It was a period of remarkable
growth and prosperity. During these years the railroads
were making special efforts to bring settlers into the
State, and Kansas was widely advertised. Reports of
the opportunities here stimulated immigration, and settlements
overspread the western prairies. Great confidence
was felt in the future of the State, and people in the East
eagerly invested in western land and property. Money
was easy to borrow, and the Kansas people borrowed
liberally and began speculating in real estate. Kansas
was soon “on the boom.” Property was bought, not to
use, but to sell again at a higher price. Cities and towns
laid out additions which were divided into lots and sold
for large sums. Expensive improvements were made, and
public and business buildings were constructed that were
far larger and more costly than the needs of the time demanded.
Railway and street-car lines were built where
there was not business enough to support them. Hundreds
of new towns were mapped out and the lots sold. Many of
these towns never existed except on paper, and most of the
others were later turned into pastures or cornfields.</p>

<p><strong>Collapse of the Boom, 1887.</strong> Since the new settlers
were not familiar with soil and climate conditions in Kansas
many of them selected land that was not adapted to
agriculture, therefore much of the farming was not profitable.
In 1887 came one of the most severe drouths that
was ever known in the country. The people lost confidence
in Kansas and the boom collapsed. Eastern people wanted
 <a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a><span class="pageno">128</span>
their money back, but there was nothing with which to
pay them. Money could not be borrowed and mortgages
were foreclosed. People who had bought property at high
prices, expecting to sell at a profit, found themselves unable
to sell at any price. Many who had counted themselves
wealthy found their property almost valueless.
Banks and business houses failed and hundreds of people
were ruined. Thousands left Kansas, some of the western
counties being almost abandoned. The year 1887 was
followed, however, by several good crop seasons. A great
deal of attention was given to the study of farm conditions,
and Kansas began to make progress again.</p>

<p><strong>The Opening of Oklahoma.</strong> In 1889 Kansas lost about
50,000 of her population. This came about through the
opening of Oklahoma to settlement. The President issued
a proclamation setting high noon of April 22 as the time
at which the settlers could enter the new country to take
claims. The opening of Oklahoma had been anxiously
awaited for years, and, as the appointed time drew near,
people from all parts of the United States began to assemble
along the southern line of Kansas. Arkansas City
was the chief gathering place, for it was at this point that
the one line of railroad entered Oklahoma. When, at noon,
April 22, the cavalrymen who patroled the borders fired
their carbines as a signal that the settlers could move across
the line, a great shout went up, and the race for claims
began. Hundreds crowded the trains, thousands rode on
fleet horses, many rode in buggies and buckboards, others
in heavy farm wagons, and some even made the race on
foot. In the morning Oklahoma was an uninhabited
prairie, at midday it was a surging mass of earnest, excited
humanity, in the evening it was a land of many people.
Within a few days the breaking plow was turning the sod
on many homesteads, while merchants, bankers, and professional
 <a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a><span class="pageno">129</span>
men were carrying on their business in tents or
in rough board shanties. The rush of settlement to Kansas
was remarkable, but the settlement of Oklahoma is
the climax in the story of American pioneering. Although
Kansas furnished such a large number of the Oklahoma
settlers, immigration to our State from the East soon made
up the loss.</p>

<p><strong>The Panic of 1893.</strong> In 1893 a financial panic extended
over the whole country, accompanied in Kansas by a
partial failure of crops. Those were dark days in Kansas,
for many of the people were still burdened with heavy
mortgages. But this period should be remembered as
our last “hard times.” Within two or three years conditions
had greatly improved. The twenty-five years following
that time brought almost uninterrupted prosperity.</p>

<p><strong>Kansas in the Spanish-American War.</strong> In 1898 the
long period of peace that the country had enjoyed since
the Civil War was broken by the Spanish-American War.
The call for soldiers was eagerly responded to in Kansas,
and four regiments were raised. Our State had furnished
seventeen regiments during the Civil War and two for
fighting the Indians, therefore the four for the Spanish-American
War were numbered the Twentieth, the Twenty-first,
the Twenty-second, and the Twenty-third. The
Twenty-third was composed of colored soldiers. The only
one of these regiments called upon to do any fighting was
the Twentieth, which was ordered to the Philippines.
There, under a Kansan, Colonel Fred Funston, the men
of this regiment took part in the campaigns that followed,
and by their bravery and efficiency brought much credit
to themselves and to their State. The Twenty-third was
sent to Cuba. The other regiments were trained and kept
in readiness, but the early end of the war prevented their
active service.</p>

<p><strong>The State Capitol.</strong> The year 1903 is an interesting one,
for it marked the completion of our State Capitol. Shortly
after the admission of Kansas to the Union the people
selected Topeka as the seat of government. As soon as
the Civil War was over and they had time to think about
public improvements they began to lay plans for building
a capitol. Every state has a capitol, or state house as it
is often called, in which there are offices for the Governor
and other state officers as well as large rooms for the meetings
of the Legislature. It is for the state what a courthouse
is for a county. It should, of course, be a fine
building, of which the people can be proud. But back
in the ’60’s Kansas people were few in number and had
little money. They could not afford to build a capitol
 <a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a><span class="pageno">133</span>
that would be large and handsome enough for the future,
nor did they wish to construct a small, cheap building
that would have to be set aside later. Instead they
planned a fine structure to be built a little at a time as
they could afford it.</p>
 <a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a><span class="pageno">132</span>

<p>In 1866 the Legislature provided for the erection of what
is now the east wing of our state house. As the State grew
in wealth and population, more money was appropriated
from time to time for the construction of other wings,
the great central portion, and lastly the high dome that
reaches nearly three hundred feet into the air. The building
was completed in 1903, having been thirty-seven years
in the making. It grew as the State grew, costing altogether
between three and four millions of dollars. It is
fitting that the great State of Kansas should now have
one of the finest capitols in the United States.</p>

<p><strong>The Floods.</strong> The people of Kansas had withstood a
number of drouths, but beginning in 1903 they were, for
the first time, visited by a series of floods. The first one
was probably the most destructive. Most of the water
came down the Kansas River from the tributaries draining
central and western Kansas, where there had been heavy
rainfall. Farms and towns along these streams were
flooded, property was swept away, and a number of lives
were lost. Topeka, Lawrence, and Kansas City, where
portions of the cities were inundated for days, suffered
heavy losses. The following year nearly every stream in
the State poured a flood of water down its valley, and
many people had to flee to the hills for safety. In 1908,
for the third time in five years, Kansas was again visited
by high water. The loss occasioned by these floods
amounted to many millions of dollars, but help poured
in to the sufferers from many sources and they straightway
began the work of repairing and rebuilding. In a short
time all traces of the calamity had disappeared.</p>

<p>Stories of floods in Kansas have been handed down
from far-off Indian days, but the earliest flood of which
there is any account was in 1844. The Indians told the
white men about it and advised against building close to
the rivers, but no attention was paid to the warning. Since
the recent floods, however, a number of people have moved
back from the streams. A few of the cities, including
Topeka, Lawrence, and Kansas City, have built dikes,
bridges have been lengthened to give streams more room,
and several railroad grades have been raised above the
danger line.</p>

<p><strong>Kansas To-day.</strong> While the floods caused much loss
and suffering, the State’s resources had become so great
that the condition of general prosperity was not seriously
affected. Each year has added to the prosperity and
progress of the State until now Kansas is one of the great
states of the Union. We have only to look about us to
see how marvelously conditions have changed since pioneer
days. Great fields and orchards are spread over what was
once the Indians’ hunting ground, and cattle have taken
the place of the roving herds of buffaloes. Tractor plows
now turn the soil where once there was only buffalo grass,
thriving towns and cities stand where once the tepee stood
and shining rails of steel mark the paths of Indian ponies
and emigrant trains.</p>

<p>All these things have been done within a single generation.
Thousands of the men and women who came into
Kansas in their wagons and drove across the unfenced
plains are still among us, but now when they journey over
the same country they go in swiftly moving trains or automobiles.
Where once they saw only the prairie and a few
settlers’ cabins they now see roads and bridges, farms and
 <a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a><span class="pageno">136</span>
ranches, stores, banks, mills, mines, and factories. They
see what they have helped to build, a great state, and they
may well be proud of it. By their unconquerable faith
and courage and their unremitting toil they have made
Kansas what it is to-day.</p>

<p><strong>Government of Kansas.</strong> As the pioneers look at their
State they may feel a pride not only in the acres that
have been brought under cultivation and the wealth that
has been produced, but also in a government that is one of
the most advanced in the Union. Many measures have
been passed to promote the welfare of the people. Among
the important ones are: the child-labor law, the truancy
law, the anti-cigarette law, the law providing for juvenile
courts, laws pertaining to public health, the fire-escape
law, the “blue sky” law, the primary-election law, and
the law governing public utilities. These are only a few,
but among the hundreds of measures that have been
passed, affecting the character of our government, none
stand out more prominently than the two amendments
to our Constitution providing for prohibition and for
woman suffrage.</p>

<p><strong>Prohibition in Kansas.</strong> Temperance was a live topic
in Kansas from the beginning; even in Territorial days laws
were passed that tended to regulate, in some degree, the
liquor traffic. During the first eighteen years of statehood
there was a constant increase in sentiment favorable to
prohibition, and, in 1880, during the administration of
Governor John P. <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John, the people voted to adopt the
following amendment to the Constitution: “The manufacture
and sale of intoxicating liquors shall be forever
prohibited in this State, except for medical, scientific, and
mechanical purposes.” The law has been strengthened
from time to time, and more attention has been given to its
enforcement, until to-day Kansas is one of the strictest
 <a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pageno">137</span>
prohibition states, and the popular sentiment against the
use of liquor is stronger here, perhaps, than anywhere else
in the United States. For many years Kansas stood
almost alone as a prohibition state, but in recent years
the number of prohibition states has increased rapidly, and
in 1918 a prohibition amendment to the National Constitution
was offered by Congress, and in 1919 it had been
ratified by the necessary two-thirds of the states. Kansas
was among the number. It is a matter of pride in Kansas
that ours was a pioneer state in this great movement.</p>

<p><strong>Woman Suffrage.</strong> Kansas has been one of the most
liberal of the states in its laws concerning the rights of
women, but it is only in recent years that Kansas women
have had full political rights. In 1861 women were given
the right to vote in district school elections, and in 1887
in city elections. The question of complete woman suffrage
was voted upon and defeated in 1867, and again in
1894, but in 1912 it carried by a large majority. Only six
states, Colorado, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Washington, and
California, preceded Kansas in granting to women the
right of suffrage. A number of other states have followed
Kansas, and now (1919) Congress has offered to the states
for ratification a woman suffrage amendment to the National
Constitution.</p>

<p><strong>Kansas in the World War.</strong> The period from the opening
of the twentieth century to the beginning of the World
War was, on the whole, one of peace and prosperity in
Kansas. No great destructive force, such as famine or
panic, left the people struggling for existence, nor did anything
occur to stir their deeper emotions. Their chief interests
were in building up their homes and their businesses
and in developing their State. But suddenly, in 1914, like
the people of the rest of the United States, they began to
 <a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pageno">139</span>
give more thought to the affairs of other countries, and
when on April 6, 1917, the United States entered the war,
the people of Kansas were ready to carry their share of
the burdens.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The young men of the State began at once to offer their
services in the national guard, in the regular army and
in the navy. There were more than 18,000 of these volunteers.
Within a few weeks Congress passed the Compulsory
Service Act, under the provisions of which approximately
42,000 Kansas men were called into service during
the war. The National Guard, numbering about 10,000
men, was soon called. Altogether there were fully 70,000
Kansans in the forces of the United States. These men
were sent to practically every organization in the army,
though the greater portion of them were in the 89th
National Army Division, the 10th Regular Army Division,
the 35th National Guard Division, and the 117th Ammunition
Train of the 42d Division. All of these except the
10th Division, which had not yet completed its training
when the armistice was signed, were sent to France, where
they took part in important engagements and bore themselves
bravely, notably the Rainbow Division in the last
battle of the Marne, the 89th at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mihiel and the Argonne,
and the 35th Division in the Argonne drive. Many of our
young men went into special branches of service, such as
the Air Service, Railway Engineering, Signal Corps,
Quartermasters Corps and Ordnance Corps. The Federal
Government established two Officers’ Training Camps in
Kansas, one at Fort Riley and one at Fort Leavenworth.
Many Kansas men attended these camps and received
commissions.</p>

<p>Hundreds of Kansas young women rendered skilled
and devoted service as nurses, both in the training camps
and overseas.</p>
<a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a><span class="pageno">140</span>

<p>The people of the State took an active part in various
kinds of war work and subscribed more than their quota
to all appeals for funds and to all bond issues.</p>

<p>Altogether, Kansas played its part in the war with its
accustomed loyalty and spirit.</p>

<p><strong>The Period Since the Civil War.</strong> In the present chapter
we have touched only in a general way upon the State’s
progress, but growth has been in many directions and
each activity has a history of its own. In order that we
may better understand the advancement that has been
made we will study more fully three of the most important
phases of the State’s progress and development&mdash;&#8203;industry,
transportation, and education.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">SUMMARY</p>

<p class="blockquote">The years since the Civil War have been eventful ones.
The Indian troubles on the frontier lasted from 1864 until
1869. Much property and more than 1000 lives were lost.
National troops and a regiment of Kansas soldiers were
required to quell the trouble. Governor Crawford resigned
his position and took command of the Kansas
troops. In 1878-’80 thousands of negroes arrived in
Kansas. This movement from the South was called the
“Exodus.” The grasshopper invasion in 1874 was followed
by ten years of prosperity. Then came the boom,
which was ended by the drouth in 1887. Eastern moneylenders
held thousands of Kansas mortgages, and though
several good crop years followed, the State had not yet
recovered when the panic in 1893 brought renewed trouble.
Good crops followed, and Kansas soon entered upon a
period of prosperity which has continued to the present
time. Kansas furnished four regiments for the Spanish-American
War in 1898, and made the most of every opportunity
to serve in the World War in 1917-’18. The
State Capitol, which was begun in 1866, was completed in
1903. The years 1903, 1904, and 1908 were the flood years.
Among the many important governmental measures are
the prohibition and woman suffrage amendments. During

the period since the Civil War Kansas has become a great
and prosperous state.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">THE INDUSTRIES OF KANSAS</h4>

<p class="p2"><strong>The Earliest Kansas Farmers.</strong> Agriculture, the leading
industry of our State, was for many years almost the
only occupation of our people. The Indians were the first
farmers in Kansas. The Comanches, in the western part
of the State, were roving hunters, but the eastern Indians
had permanent homes and tilled the soil. They were both
hunters and farmers. A government agent in describing
their mode of living says: “They raise annually small
crops of corn, beans, and pumpkins. These they cultivate
entirely with the hoe, in the simplest manner. Their crops
are usually planted in April, and receive one dressing before
they leave their villages for the summer hunt in May.”</p>

<p><strong>Agriculture Taught to the Indians.</strong> When Kansas was
made an Indian country the National Government agreed
in the treaties to supply the Indians with cattle, hogs, and
farming implements, and to employ persons to teach them
agriculture. In accordance with this agreement several
government farms were established, and both the government
farmers and the missionaries taught agriculture to
the Indians. By the time Kansas was organized as a
Territory, in 1854, there were a number of farms in the
different reservations and at the missions, and the produce
was such as to show that the soil of Kansas is remarkably
fertile.</p>

<p><strong>Agriculture During Territorial Days.</strong> Most of the early
settlers of Kansas were farmers, but during Territorial
days the political and governmental troubles made much
progress in farming impossible. The terrible season of
1860 made a dreary closing for this period, and confirmed
 <a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a><span class="pageno">143</span>
in the minds of many eastern people the old idea that
Kansas was fit only for Indians, buffaloes, and prairie dogs.</p>

<p><strong>Agriculture During the Civil War.</strong> The year following
the drouth brought a good crop, but it also brought the
beginning of the Civil War which absorbed the energies of
the settlers for four years more. It was not until the close
of the war, in 1865, that agriculture
can be said to have
had a real beginning in Kansas.
But, in spite of the poverty
and hardships of the war years,
two things of especial significance
were done that showed
the interest of the pioneers in
agriculture. During this period
the Agricultural College
at Manhattan was established,
and the State Agricultural
Society was formed.
The object of the Society was
“to promote the improvement
of agriculture and its kindred
arts throughout the State of
Kansas.” Under its management
a state fair was held at
Leavenworth in 1863, and in
that year the Legislature appropriated
$1000 for the benefit of
the Society. These events are worthy of note because
they showed the enterprise of the people when their
resources were small.</p>

 <p class="p0 unindent blockquote muchsmaller">Erected in 1863. This was a gristmill, an octagon
shaped, four-story structure, having a genuine
Holland windmill for motive power. Additional
buildings were erected for the manufacture of
wagons and farming implements. The mill was
abandoned many years ago, and in 1905 it burned.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>Early Farming Implements.</strong> The farming implements
of the pioneers were few and simple. Much of the machinery
of to-day had not then been invented. Because
of the cost of transportation, and the lack of money
among the settlers, even the machinery of that day
was scarce in Kansas. The all-important implement was
the plow. The pioneer’s first crop was usually “sod
corn.” The field was prepared with a breaking plow,
which threw up the
sod in parallel strips
from two to five
inches in thickness.
Then the farmer,
with an ax or a
spade and a bag of
seed corn, walked
back and forth
across the field,
prying apart or
gashing the sod at
regular intervals
and dropping into
each opening three
or four grains of corn.
Then he waited for
the crop. Once the
land was broken, it
was, in after years,
prepared for the
seed with the stirring
plow and the
harrow, and planting
was done with
a hand planter. Later the corn planter drawn by a
team came into use. This machine required a driver,
and another person to work the lever that dropped the
corn. Then came the planter with the checkrower which,
 <a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a><span class="pageno">145</span>
when attached to the planter, made only a driver necessary.
During the last few years the lister has come
into very general use.</p>

 <p class="caption"><span class="sc">Corn Binder.</span></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>The early settlers cultivated their corn with a single-shovel
cultivator drawn by one horse. With this cultivator
it was necessary to make a trip along each side of
every row of corn. The double-shovel cultivator soon
came into use, but it, also, was drawn by one horse and
cultivated but one side of the row at a time. This labor
was greatly reduced by the invention of the cultivator
drawn by a team and having shovels for both sides of the
corn row. Now cultivators may be had that till two rows
at a time. Formerly the farmer cut all of his corn by hand
with a knife. Now he uses the riding corn binder.</p>
<a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a><span class="pageno">146</span>

<p>Great as has been the improvement in corn machinery,
even greater changes have come about in the machinery
used for the wheat crop. The earliest harvesting implement
used in Kansas was the cradle, a scythe with long
fingers parallel with the blade to catch the grain as it was
cut. The cradler laid the grain in rows. A second man
followed with a rake and gathered the wheat into small
piles, which he tied into bundles, using some of the straw
for bands. The next machine was the reaper, which carried
two men, one to drive the team and one to push off
the wheat whenever enough had been cut to make a
bundle. The reaper required four or five binders to follow
it. It was soon improved by being made self-dumping,
and later, self-binding. Inventions and improvements have
followed in rapid succession, and to-day the planting and
harvesting of wheat can be done with remarkable speed
and efficiency.</p>

<p>The many wonderful inventions in farm machinery have
made possible in the farming of to-day a great saving of
time and labor as compared with the farming of forty years
ago. There are few lines in which greater progress has
been made.</p>

<p><strong>Agriculture Between 1860 and 1880.</strong> For several years
after the Civil War the population of Kansas increased
more rapidly than did the crops, and the country was
kept poor. The destruction of crops by the grasshoppers
in 1874 retarded immigration and left the people discouraged.
Several good crop years followed, however,
and confidence in the agricultural future of Kansas soon
returned. By 1880 nearly 9,000,000 acres of land were in
cultivation, a third of which was planted to corn and a
fourth to wheat. The next largest acreage was in oats.
A number of other crops were reported, including rye,
barley, buckwheat, sorghum, cotton, hemp, tobacco,
broom corn, millet, clover, and blue grass. At that time
not a great deal was known of the soil or climate of the
State, and we find in this list of crops several that have
since been found unprofitable and are no longer raised in
any considerable quantities.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>Agriculture from 1880 to 1887.</strong> The year 1880 found
the people of Kansas full of hope and courage, and from
that time until the drouth of 1887 agriculture developed
rapidly. It was a period of new ideas and new methods.
Millions of additional acres were brought into cultivation.
The principal crops, corn, wheat, and oats, were each
greatly increased. Fields of timothy, clover, orchard
grass, and blue grass were planted in the central counties,
and even farther west. Soil that a few years before had
been considered unfit for farming was now producing
crops. The State was being rapidly settled, many miles
of railroad were in operation, and the excellent crops
did much to encourage the “boom” of 1885 to 1887.</p>

<p><strong>Agriculture from 1887 to 1893.</strong> The period of good crops
following the dry season of 1887 lasted for five years, and
it was a time of great activity along many lines of agricultural
advancement. By 1890 nearly 16,000,000 acres
had been brought under cultivation. This area was almost
double the areas under cultivation ten years earlier.</p>

<p><strong>Western Kansas.</strong> Before 1890 most of the farming was
done in the eastern and central parts of the State, the
western part being considered poorly adapted to agricultural
purposes. During the next few years, however, it
was shown that wheat can be successfully raised clear to
the Colorado line. The sorghum crops also proved to be
well adapted to this section. The soil of western Kansas
was found to be wonderfully fertile, needing only moisture
 <a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a><span class="pageno">149</span>
to make it produce abundantly. A more thorough understanding
of soil and climate has brought better methods
of tillage, and this, together with a careful selection of
crops, is making the yield much larger and more certain.</p>

<p><strong>Irrigation in Western Kansas.</strong> The possibilities of
irrigation for this section of the country have long been
given much consideration. For several years water from
 <a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a><span class="pageno">151</span>
the Arkansas River was successfully used. Colorado,
however, in developing irrigation, used so much of the
water from the upper Arkansas that there was not a sufficient
amount left for our State. Investigation resulted
in the discovery of an underground water supply. This
water, which is called the underflow, moves eastward from
the Rocky Mountains through strata of gravel and sand.
It offers to a large part of western Kansas a practically
inexhaustible supply of water for irrigation. Wells are
bored into this underflow and the water is pumped for
irrigating purposes. Only a small part of western Kansas
is under irrigation as yet, but experiments for the purpose
of finding the best methods of utilizing the underflow are
being carried on by individuals, by experiment stations,
and by the State. Irrigation by pumping is bringing about
a remarkable agricultural advancement in western Kansas.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>Alfalfa.</strong> About 1890 several new crops came into prominence
in Kansas, the most important of which was alfalfa.
Alfalfa is now grown in every county of Kansas and has
become one of our foremost crops. Because of its long,
penetrating roots it can be grown successfully without
irrigation even in most of the drier parts of Kansas. As
its many points of excellence become better known its
acreage is constantly increasing. Kansas produces more
alfalfa than any other state in the Union.</p>

<p>Sweet clover and Soudan grass have increased so much
in acreage in very recent years that they are rapidly becoming
important crops in this state.</p>

<p><strong>The Sorghum Crops.</strong> Another of the new crops was
Kafir corn, which has also proved very valuable. This
plant is a variety of sorghum. Other varieties had been
raised in Kansas for many years, especially the sweet sorghum
that could be used for making sugar and molasses.
Broom corn is another sorghum crop that has been grown
 <a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a><span class="pageno">153</span>
in Kansas for a long while and is raised in large quantities
in the southwestern part of the State. In more recent
years two more sorghums, milo and feterita, give promise
of becoming valuable forage crops.</p>

<p><strong>Sugar Beets.</strong> During the early ’80’s considerable sugar
had been made from sorghum cane, but in 1889 it was, for
the first time, made from beets. For a number of years
experiments were made with sugar beets in different parts
of western Kansas. To encourage sugar-beet raising a
bounty was offered by the State, and a good many tons
were raised and shipped to sugar factories in Colorado and
Nebraska. In 1906 a large factory was completed at
Garden City, and the raising of sugar beets has become
an important industry in that part of Kansas. Efforts are
now being made to introduce this crop into other parts of
the State.</p>

<p><strong>The Twenty-five Years Following 1893.</strong> Progress was
checked in 1893 by the financial panic that extended
throughout the country. Values dropped, and prices were
low on everything the farmers had to sell. In addition to
 <a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><span class="pageno">155</span>
the panic, Kansas suffered a crop failure in most parts of
the State. That was a discouraging period, but within a
few years Kansas had recovered. From that time until
the present there has been a steady rise in all values. Owing
largely to the fact that there is no longer any free land to
be taken as homesteads, land prices have steadily risen.
The price of land products has also greatly increased. In
1893 corn was worth but ten to fifteen cents a bushel and
wheat from thirty to forty cents. A comparison of these
with present prices serves to show how great has been
the change.</p>

<p><strong>Kansas Wheat.</strong> Kansas is now one of the leading agricultural
states of the Union. It produces a greater variety
of crops than does almost any other state, but the principal
ones are now, as they have been from the earliest days,
corn and wheat. In recent years alfalfa has come to be
a close third. Wheat is our most noted crop. Kansas is
unsurpassed in the production of this grain. Wheat is
grown in every county in the State, but by far the greatest
 <a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pageno">156</span>
quantity comes from the “wheat belt,” which extends
across the middle of the State, from north to south. Most
of the Kansas wheat is of the winter varieties commonly
called “Turkey wheats,” first brought here from southern
Russia by the Mennonites in 1873.</p>

<p><strong>The Corn Crop.</strong> Corn was raised here by the Indians,
and from the time of the settlement of the Territory until
very recent years it was the leading crop and the greatest
source of Kansas wealth. Since 1913, however, wheat has
been the most valuable crop of the State and corn has
had to take second place. Corn is raised in all parts of
the State, but much the largest portion is produced in the
eastern half. It is on this crop that the great live-stock industries
of Kansas most depend.</p>

<p><strong>The Live-stock Industry.</strong> The live-stock industry is
one of the important interests of the State. The grain and
 <a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a><span class="pageno">157</span>
forage crops, the large areas of good pasture, the plentiful
supply of water, and the nearness to market, all combine
to make Kansas an excellent live-stock region. The raising
and fattening of cattle and hogs constitute the chief
features of this industry, although there are a number of
others, prominent among which is dairying.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

 <p class="caption"><span class="sc">Early Day Stock Farm.</span></p>

<p>The early farmers had their herds and flocks, but paid
little attention to quality or breeds. In time it was found
that better grades were more profitable, and the early
range cattle and the scrub stock of the pioneers have
disappeared.</p>

<p class="p2">When the Union Pacific Railroad was built the cattlemen
of Texas began driving their cattle into Kansas in
order to ship them to market. For many years Abilene
was the shipping center. When the Santa Fe Railway was
built, Wichita, being farther south, became the chief shipping
point. As the country became more thickly settled
the cattle trade was pushed farther west. Finally it
reached Dodge City which remained the shipping center
 <a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a><span class="pageno">159</span>
for many years. The building of railroads into the Southwest
made it unnecessary for the Texas cattlemen to drive
their stock to a Kansas shipping point, and about 1885
the practice was abandoned. While the trade flourished,
the cowboy, with his boots and spurs and broad-brimmed
hat, was a familiar figure on the plains of western Kansas;
but as the settlers turned the grazing land into farms the
cowboy moved farther west.</p>

<p><strong>Horticulture.</strong> Another Kansas industry is horticulture,
the cultivation of fruits. The first orchard in Kansas was
planted at Shawnee Mission in 1837. Very little tree
planting was done, however, until after the Civil War,
and even then the Kansas plains were for many years
regarded as unfit for fruit growing. The early crops were
 <a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a><span class="pageno">160</span>
small but of a very fine quality, and Kansas apples won
the gold medal at the Centennial Exposition at Philadelphia
in 1876. This aroused much enthusiasm, and during
the next few years many thousands of fruit trees were
planted, but most of them proved worthless because the
varieties were not adapted
to conditions in this State.
Long years of hard work and
patient effort were required
to secure the knowledge
necessary to make a successful
fruit state of Kansas.
To-day there are many fruits
grown here, but it is the Kansas
apple that is famous.
Scarcely a farm in the eastern
and central parts of the
State is without its orchard,
and there are a number of
commercial orchards that are
making horticulture an important
industry in Kansas.</p>

<p><strong>Farmers’ Organizations.</strong> The farmers of the State have
at different times, especially in the earlier years, formed a
number of organizations. An early organization was the
Order of Patrons of Husbandry, or the “Grange,” a
national movement, introduced into Kansas in 1872. Its
general purpose was the improvement of farm life. Many
granges were organized during the ’70’s. The Farmers’
Cooperative Association, begun in 1873, and the Farmers’
Mutual Benefit Association in 1883, had for their general
purposes the cooperation of the farmers in buying and
selling and in securing lower freight rates.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>About 1888 the Farmers’ Alliance, already a national
organization, formed many local organizations in Kansas.
The Alliance demanded a number of measures for the
betterment of the farmers, including lower freight and
passenger rates, and better mortgage, debtor, and tax
laws. The Farmers’ Alliance was a widespread movement
and, for a time, overshadowed all other farmers’ organizations.
In 1890 the People’s party, or the Populist party,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_17" id="fnanchor_17"></a><a href="#footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></span>
as it came to be called, took over the political work of the
 <a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a><span class="pageno">163</span>
Farmers’ Alliance, and that organization gradually disappeared.
The Farmers’ Educational and Cooperative
Union of Kansas is a more recent organization.</p>

<p><strong>The State Board of Agriculture.</strong> In 1872 the Agricultural
Society, organized during the Civil War, was
changed into the State Board of Agriculture. For a
number of years this Board gave especial attention to
gathering and distributing information concerning the resources
of the State for the purpose of stimulating immigration.
Later it began the work of furnishing to the
farmers information concerning methods of farming best
adapted to Kansas conditions. These activities have been
continued, and the Board of Agriculture has been of great
practical value to the State.</p>

<p><strong>Work of the Agricultural College.</strong> The Agricultural
College in its early years laid but little stress on agricultural
and industrial work, but in 1873 its plan of work was
changed and it soon began to fulfill its real mission. A few
years later the usefulness of the College was greatly increased
by the establishment of an experiment station
where investigations are carried on in such matters as the
testing of seeds, the introduction of new crops, the rotation
of crops, dairy and animal husbandry, butter and cheese
making, orchard and crop pests, stock foods, and diseases
of live stock. Branch experiment stations have, in later
years, been established at Hays, Garden City, Dodge City,
Tribune, and Colby, where problems peculiar to the western
part of the State are studied. The Agricultural College
is doing a great work in gathering information and bringing
it to the people by means of bulletins, lectures, correspondence
courses, demonstration trains, demonstration
agents, and farmers’ institutes. Kansas was one of the
first states to hold a Farmers’ Institute in connection with
its Agricultural College. This work was begun in 1869,
 <a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a><span class="pageno">165</span>
and the purpose was then, as it is to-day, to promote the
knowledge of scientific agriculture.</p>

</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>Manufactures Based on Agriculture.</strong> The agricultural
resources of Kansas have led to the development of a
number of manufacturing industries. One of the oldest of
these is milling. Among the first needs of the settlers of
the new country was a means of grinding their corn and
wheat into meal and flour for family use. This caused the
building of small gristmills in every community. Most of
them were built along streams and were run by water
power, though a few of the early ones used wind power.
In later years steam has come to be generally used.
After the introduction of the hard wheats, the wheat crop
came to be much more certain, the acreage increased, and
the milling industry grew. Kansas flour is now sold in all
the important markets of the world, and Kansas is one of
the leading states in the milling industry.</p>
<a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a><span class="pageno">166</span>

<p>Meat packing has held first place among the manufacturing
industries of Kansas for a number of years.
Kansas City, the second greatest packing center in the
United States, is the chief market for Kansas live stock,
but there are several packing houses in different parts of
the State. Creameries, canning factories, and pickling
works represent other industries that have been developed
to make use of our agricultural products.</p>

<p><strong>The Mineral Industries.</strong> Although Kansas is not one
of the great mining states, it has a number of valuable
mineral resources, the chief of which are coal, lead, zinc,
oil, gas, salt, building stone, and gypsum. These resources
form the basis of an important part of the industrial life
of the State. The coal and gas have made possible a
number of manufacturing industries.</p>

<p><strong>Coal.</strong> As early as the Territorial period it was known
that there were coal fields in Kansas, and small amounts
of coal were mined in Crawford and Cherokee counties.
Immediately after the Civil War the settlers in the southeastern
part of the State gave much attention to the digging
of coal, some of which lay so near the surface that it
could be uncovered with a plow. Within the next few
years coal was found in Osage and Leavenworth counties
and in the vicinity of Fort Scott. These places produced
large amounts, but Crawford and Cherokee counties soon
came to be the leading coal districts of the State. At the
present time about nine-tenths of the Kansas output is
mined in these two counties. The importance of the coal
fields of Kansas lies not only in the value of the coal, but
in the stimulation of the growth of manufactures. Many
industries can be carried on only by means of large
amounts of fuel to supply power. The development of a
number of such industries in Kansas has been made possible
chiefly by the cheap and abundant supply of coal.</p>
<a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a><span class="pageno">167</span>

<p><strong>Lead and Zinc.</strong> Before Kansas was organized as a
Territory lead mining was an important industry in southwest
Missouri, but not until 1876 was it discovered that
the lead and zinc field extends into the southeast corner
of Kansas. Prospecting began at once and thousands of
people were soon on the ground. Although zinc was found
in abundance with the lead, but little attention was paid
to it. Within a few years, however, it was found that the
abundance of coal made the smelting of zinc profitable,
and zinc soon assumed the leading place. For a number
of years much more zinc than lead has been produced.
A large amount of ore from the Missouri mines is shipped
to the Kansas smelters, and the smelting of lead and zinc,
but particularly of zinc, has come to be one of the most
important of our mineral industries. The development
of the gas field furnished a cheaper and more abundant
fuel than coal, and much of the smelting was soon being
done where gas could be used. In later years gas is less
abundant and there is a tendency to return to the use
of coal.</p>

<p><strong>Oil and Gas.</strong> Although prospecting had been done in
earlier years, the real development of oil and gas in Kansas
began about 1892, with the discovery of the big Kansas-Oklahoma
field. The oil and gas area is included within
an irregular strip, forty to fifty miles wide, extending from
Kansas City southwesterly into Oklahoma. It is frequently
spoken of as the “oil and gas belt.”</p>

<p>By 1900 nearly every town in the gas belt had more gas
than it knew what to do with, and various manufacturing
enterprises, such as brick plants, zinc smelters, glass
factories, and Portland cement mills, were soon attracted
to these towns. A little later gas was being supplied to
cities outside of the gas belt. Pipe lines were laid to Wellington,
Wichita, Hutchinson, Topeka, Lawrence, Kansas
 <a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a><span class="pageno">168</span>
City, Leavenworth, Atchison, and many of the towns
between. After ten years of this greatly increased use of
gas the supply became less abundant, and now it is feared
that the supply from this field may fail at no distant date.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

 width="264"
 alt="Illustration: Oil Well"
 />
 <p class="caption"><span class="sc">Oil Well, or “Gusher.”</span></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p>In the earlier
years the oil was all
carried in tank cars,
but a system of
pipe lines for carrying
it was soon laid.
Many refineries
were soon established.
The crude
oil is used chiefly
for fuel and for machine
oil. In the refineries
it is made
into benzine, gasoline,
and kerosene.
Vaseline and paraffin
are among the
by-products.</p>

<p>In 1914 oil and
gas were discovered
in Butler County.
Within two years
this field was yielding
such large quantities
of oil that
the total production
of the State was
more than doubled.
During the next year, 1917, more than three times as
much oil was produced as in 1916, and Kansas had become
 <a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a><span class="pageno">169</span>
the greatest oil-producing state in the Union. The output
of the Butler County field is still increasing, and its
remarkable yield will probably continue for several years.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

 alt="Illustration: Salt Plant"

 <p class="caption"><span class="sc">Salt Plant at Hutchinson.</span></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>Salt.</strong> Salt is found in Kansas as a brine in the salt
marshes, and as beds of rock salt lying beneath the surface.
The marshes were known to the early hunters and settlers,
and through the early years of statehood a little salt was
manufactured from this brine. In the late ’80’s the rock
salt beds were discovered and the salt-making industry
was rapidly developed. The center of the salt industry is
now, as it has been from the beginning, at Hutchinson.
Salt is found in a large part of Kansas, but the most valuable
area extends across the middle of the State from north
to south. This great bed of salt is in most places from two
hundred and fifty to four hundred feet thick. Some salt
is made by crushing the rock salt, but the greater portion
is made by the evaporation of brines. The brines are
obtained by forcing a stream of water through rock salt.</p>
<a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a><span class="pageno">170</span>

<p><strong>Brick.</strong> Brickmaking in Kansas dates from the early
years. Brick clays are found in many parts of the State,
but the industry is carried on chiefly in the eastern part
of the State, especially in the gas belt, because of the fuel
supply.</p>

<p><strong>Gypsum.</strong> Gypsum beds are found in the central part
of Kansas, especially around Blue Rapids and in Saline,
Dickinson, and Barber counties. Plaster of Paris, used
chiefly for making plaster for covering wall surfaces, is
made from gypsum.</p>

 <p class="caption"><span class="sc">Stone Quarry.</span></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>Portland Cement.</strong> Portland cement is a comparatively
new product in the United States. The development of
this industry in Kansas commenced about 1900. Portland
cement is made from certain mixtures of rock substances,
 <a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a><span class="pageno">171</span>
put through processes of grinding and heating. Its chief
use is in making concrete, which is widely used for construction
work. There are a number of Portland cement mills
in the gas belt.</p>

<p><strong>Glass.</strong> Gas is the most satisfactory fuel for glassmaking,
and since the gas field in Kansas was opened a
number of glass factories have been established in the
State. Sand of a good quality for making glass has also
been found in southeastern Kansas.</p>

<p><strong>Agriculture the Basis of Material Progress.</strong> At present
there are numbers of factories in Kansas, engaged in many
different lines of work. Our industries are constantly
growing in number and importance, and it takes all of them
to make a well-rounded state, but it is the agricultural
industries that form the basis of our prosperity. On these
we must depend, and the history of agriculture in Kansas
is, largely, the history of our material progress.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">SUMMARY</p>

<p class="blockquote">The principal agricultural industries of the State are
farming, stock raising and horticulture. The principal
mineral industries are concerned with coal, lead, zinc, oil,
gas, salt, building stone, and gypsum. The leading manufacturing
industries are concerned largely with agricultural
and mineral products, and are carried on most extensively
in the coal and gas regions.</p>

<p class="blockquote">Drouths, which occur in all agricultural regions, have
been most severe in Kansas in the following years: 1860,
1869, 1874, 1887, 1893, 1913. These years have marked
into periods what has otherwise been a steady progress in
agriculture.</p>

<p class="blockquote">The Agricultural Society, organized during the Civil
War, was, in 1872, changed into the State Board of Agriculture.
The Agricultural College, established during the
Civil War, began active work along agricultural lines in
1873. There have been a number of organizations of
farmers, most of them between 1870 and 1890.</p>
<a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a><span class="pageno">172</span>

<p class="blockquote">Advancement in agriculture has been made in area
under cultivation, selection of crops, improvements in
machinery, better methods of tillage, and irrigation. The
leading crops are now corn, wheat, and alfalfa.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">TRANSPORTATION IN KANSAS</h4>

<p class="p2"><strong>The Beginning of Railroads in the United States.</strong>
About the time Kansas was becoming the highway for
the Santa Fe trade, experiments were being made in England
with a new invention, the steam locomotive. By
1825 a fair degree of success had been attained. During
the next half dozen years experiments were carried on in
the United States, and by 1831 several short railroad lines
were in use. By 1850 one could travel by rail between the
chief cities of the East and as far west as <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, but a
decade more passed before any railroads were built in
Kansas.</p>

<p><strong>Kansas Settlers Desire Railroads.</strong> The agitation for
railroads in this part of the country began even before the
organization of the Kansas Territory. The settlers knew
the difficulty of building up the State without the aid of
the railway. They had crept across the prairies in their
canvas-covered wagons, or had toiled up the shallow, sluggish
waterways, and they foresaw that they would be
unable to market their crops or their stock because of the
lack of adequate means of transportation. Their great
desire for railroads is made evident by the large number
of railway charters granted to different companies by
the Territorial Legislatures. On account of the immense
cost of railroad construction, however, work was slow to
begin.</p>

<p><strong>Early Stage Lines.</strong> While the West was waiting for its
railroads a number of stage routes for carrying mail and
passengers were established. The first one was over the
Santa Fe Trail. Stages made the trip from Kansas City
 <a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a><span class="pageno">175</span>
to Santa Fe in about fifteen days. For many years stage
lines were operated between the different towns of the
Territory. Later, lines were established to Denver, to
Salt Lake, and even to San Francisco.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

 alt="Illustration: Stage Coach"

 <p class="caption"><span class="sc">Stage Coach</span>.</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>The Pony Express, 1859-’61.</strong> The trip to San Francisco,
a distance of about 2000 miles, occupied nearly a month, and
the people of California were very anxious that a quicker
way of getting their mails be devised. To meet this demand
the Pony Express was established in 1859. The line
extended from <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Joseph to San Francisco, a long, lonely
way across plains and deserts and over mountains, sometimes
in a straight line but often winding through dark
cañons or along the edge of mountain precipices. The
Pony Express required one hundred and ninety stations,
nearly five hundred horses, and eighty riders. The stations
averaged about ten miles apart. The horses were
selected for their speed and endurance, and the distance
 <a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a><span class="pageno">176</span>
from one station to another was covered in the shortest
possible time. At each station a fresh horse was waiting,
and the only delay was in changing the mail pouch from
one horse to another. The pouch contained only letters,
and they were written on the thinnest of paper to avoid
surplus weight. Five dollars was charged for the carrying
of each letter. The first trip was made in ten days, the
shortest one in seven days and seventeen hours. Many
stories of adventure are related of the two years in which
the Pony Express was in operation. In 1861 a telegraph
line was constructed across the continent, which made it
possible to flash news from ocean to ocean in a few seconds,
and the Pony Express went out of existence.</p>

<p><strong>The First Railroad in Kansas, 1860.</strong> By this time railroad
building had begun in Kansas. The first road was
laid in the spring of 1860, while Kansas was still a Territory,
between Elwood, opposite <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Joseph, Missouri, and
Marysville. When the first five miles of rail had been
laid, a little old locomotive that had done service on many
eastern roads was brought into the State and a celebration
was held in honor of the first trip. Though the engine was
old and drew only a few flat cars over the rough and
crooked track, it was an important event, for it marked
the beginning of railroad building in Kansas.</p>

<p><strong>The Union Pacific Railroad, 1862-’69.</strong> There had long
been talk of a railroad to the Pacific coast, and in 1862,
while the Civil War was still in progress, Congress granted
a charter for such a line. This was the beginning of the
Union Pacific Railroad. It was to be built as soon as
possible by working from both ends. From the east the
road was to pass through Nebraska and on toward Salt
Lake, and from the west it was to be built from San Francisco
eastward until the two lines met. This road did not
pass through Kansas, but while it was being constructed
 <a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a><span class="pageno">177</span>
a line that later became a part of the Union Pacific<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_18" id="fnanchor_18"></a><a href="#footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></span> system
was built from Kansas City westward, along the Kansas
River, through Manhattan, Junction City, and Salina,
and on west through Denver to join the main line at
Cheyenne.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_19" id="fnanchor_19"></a><a href="#footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>During the seven years spent in building this railroad
many difficulties were met and conquered. Most of the
country along the line was without timber, fuel, or any of
the necessary supplies. The materials for construction
were brought up the Missouri River by steamboat to
Kansas City. From this point they were hauled by train
over the new railroad as far as it was completed. The
Indians opposed the work because it meant the westward
movement of civilization and the settling of their hunting
grounds. They were a constant source of danger to the
 <a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a><span class="pageno">178</span>
whole frontier, but especially to the railroad builders. The
men usually went to their work armed, and stacked their
guns ready for instant use. Sometimes it was even necessary
to guard the men with troops while they worked.
History gives many accounts of Indian massacres committed
along the line of the Union Pacific Railroad. The
entire line was finished in 1869.</p>

<p><strong>The Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe, Completed in 1872.</strong>
In the meantime other lines had been chartered through
Kansas, the principal one being the Atchison, Topeka &amp;
Santa Fe. This railroad was begun at Topeka in 1868
and completed to the western boundary of the State in
a little more than four years. The line between Topeka
and Atchison was also completed within this period. The
Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe has since been extended
westward to the coast and eastward to Chicago, and many
branches have been added. This railroad follows the
 <a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a><span class="pageno">179</span>
general direction of the Santa Fe Trail across the eastern
half of the State. Near Great Bend the track runs on the
exact course of the old highway, and from this point on
through the rest of the State they are never far apart and
often coincide. When, in 1872, the “Santa Fe,” as it is
generally called, was completed through Kansas, the last
caravan of wagons had wound its way over the old Trail.
The trains of cars rushing over the new iron trail marked
another advance in the westward march of civilization.</p>

<p><strong>Railroad Companies Receive Land Grants.</strong> The immense
cost of railroad construction, the sparsely settled
country, and the limited amount of traffic, made the early
building of railroads a risky undertaking. But railroads
were needed in order to unite the West to the East as well
 <a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a><span class="pageno">180</span>
as for the development of the new country, and in order
to encourage their building Congress adopted the policy
of making liberal land grants to railroad companies. The
Union Pacific through Kansas was given land amounting
to a strip ten miles wide on each side of its line. Several
other companies, including the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa
Fe, received grants amounting to five miles on each side.
This policy brought about the rapid building of railroads,
but when the State became fairly well supplied the land
grants were discontinued. Much of the land was later
forfeited by the companies through failure to meet the
conditions of their grants.</p>

<p><strong>Railroad Companies Interested in Settlement.</strong> When
the early railroads were first built across Kansas there
were but few people living in the western part of the State.
Since population was necessary to the prosperity of the
railroad companies, these companies gave much attention
to the matter of increasing the settlements along their
lines. They sent land agents throughout the United States
and Europe, they invited people of prominence to join
excursions through Kansas, and they filled the newspapers
with descriptions of the great West. Kansas was widely
and favorably advertised. Interest was everywhere
aroused and many people were attracted to the State.</p>

<p><strong>Mennonite Settlements.</strong> The railroad companies succeeded
in planting a number of colonies of foreigners on
their lands. Among them were the settlements of Mennonites
in Reno, Harvey, Marion, and McPherson counties.
These people came from Russia for religious freedom.
“They came simultaneously with the grasshoppers but
outstayed them.” The first party, in 1874, numbered
1900 people, and many more followed rapidly until there
are now many thousands of these people in Kansas. They
brought a considerable amount of money with them and
 <a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a><span class="pageno">181</span>
were able to purchase their land. The Mennonites were
farmers, a thrifty, industrious people who have contributed
much toward making Kansas a great agricultural State.</p>

<p><strong>Swedish Settlements.</strong> Swedes had been coming to
Kansas since Territorial days. In 1871 the Union Pacific
sold a large tract of land in Saline County for a Swedish
settlement. This settlement has increased and others
have been formed until there are now many people of this
nationality in Kansas. Lindsborg, almost entirely Swedish,
is their religious and social center. It is noted for its
school of music. Most of these people came in poverty,
but they have converted the bare prairies into fine agricultural
districts and have become prosperous citizens.
They are an industrious, intelligent, progressive, and law-abiding
people.</p>

<p>Other colonies have settled in various parts of the State;
among these, German-Russians in Russell, Rush, and
Ellis counties, Scotch in Republic County, English in
Clay County, and Bohemians in Ellsworth County. There
are, at present, people of many nationalities in Kansas.</p>

<p><strong>Relation of Railroads to State’s Industries.</strong> Not only
did the early building of railroads do much to bring about
the rapid settlement of Kansas, but it hastened the development
of practically all of the State’s industries. For
instance, the railroads have made it possible for the farmer
to market his live stock and his crops. Out of these better
market facilities have grown the great meat-packing centers
and the flouring mills. On the other hand, the growth
of settlements and industries has brought prosperity to
the railroads and they have increased in wealth, equipment,
and mileage. Thus the relation between the railroads
and the State’s progress is very close.</p>

<p>There are at present nearly 10,000 miles of railroad in
Kansas, most of it belonging to the four great companies,
 <a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a><span class="pageno">182</span>
the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe, the Missouri Pacific,
the Union Pacific, and the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific.</p>

<p><strong>Railroad Regulation.</strong> There has been but little railroad
building in Kansas for a number of years for the State is
now fairly well supplied. Almost every county now has
one or more railroads. In the earlier years the important
thing was to get the railroads. Having secured them, the
matter of chief concern has been to regulate them. During
the late ’70’s much dissatisfaction arose because railroad
rates were high, and several attempts were made to place
the matter of rate regulation under the control of the State.
In 1883 a law was passed creating a Railroad Commission
of three members. This Commission was given a great
deal of power, especially in regard to revising and establishing
rates, and in adjusting disputes between the railroads
and their patrons. Within a few years, through the
efforts of the Commission together with the increase in
business resulting from a growing population, rates were
reduced almost half. Since its work proved to be of great
service to the people the Commission was continued. In
1911 the Railroad Commission became the Public Utilities
Commission, which was given control over all such corporations
as railroads, electric lines, and telegraph and
telephone systems, in matters that are of interest only to
this particular State. In matters that concern more than
one state the Interstate Commerce Commission may act.</p>
<a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a><span class="pageno">183</span>

<p>When the United States entered the World War it
became evident that one of the big problems to be met
was that of transportation, within our own country, of
men and supplies. The solution decided upon was that
of government control of the railroads, which was secured
by placing a director-general in charge of all the railroads
of the United States. It was provided that this control
might be continued for a period of twenty-one months
after the close of the war.</p>

<p><strong>Interurban Lines.</strong> Within recent years our means of
transportation have been increased by the building of
electric railway lines. They usually extend from one city
to another, and are therefore called interurban lines.
Most of those already built are in the southeastern part
of the State. Plans were under way for a number of additional
lines, but the coming of the War checked practically
all of this work. The return of normal conditions
will doubtless see a large increase in interurban mileage.</p>

<p><strong>Road Improvement.</strong> The building of railroads did not
make wagon roads less important, but more so, for there
must be plenty of good roads if the people are to make
full use of the railroads. The development of roads in
this State has been going forward since the earliest days.
Time, money, and effort are required to build roads in a
new country, and during the years that Kansas has been
engaged in this great task many different plans have been
tried out and many road laws have been passed from time
to time, but it was not until after Congress passed an act
providing federal aid in road making that a unified plan
for the whole State became a fact. This act was passed in
1916, and Kansas accepted its provisions in 1917. Since
that time remarkable progress has been made. A system
of State highways forming a network over the entire State
has been selected, thousands of miles of which are “federal-aid
 <a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a><span class="pageno">184</span>
roads”; a complete system of connecting county roads
has been designated; information has been compiled and
distributed concerning the making of different kinds of
roads, as earth, oiled earth, gravel, water-bound macadam,
bituminous macadam, asphaltic concrete, concrete, and
brick; bridge and culvert building have been standardized;
and many miles of hard-surfaced roads have already been
built or are in process of construction. Road building in
Kansas is now progressing at a rate far beyond that of
any time in the past.</p>

<p><strong>Motor Truck Service.</strong> Much of the attention now
being given to road improvement has been brought about
by the rapidly increasing use of the automobile. During
the earlier years of the automobile it was used chiefly for
the transportation of passengers, but the development of
the motor truck is making it an important factor in freight
transportation. Many lines of motor truck service already
have been established in the State, but on account of the
uncertain condition of most of the roads the service is
necessarily irregular. With the building of hard-surfaced
roads the motor truck will no doubt soon become a fully
established part of our transportation system.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">SUMMARY</p>

<p class="blockquote">Railroad construction was begun in the United States
about 1830. By 1850 railroads reached as far west as
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis. Many stage lines were established in early
Kansas. The first railroad was built in Kansas in 1860;
the line extended from Elwood to Marysville. The Union
Pacific was built through Kansas between 1862 and 1869.
The Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway was completed
in 1872. In the meantime a number of other roads were
built. The railroads received large grants of land, which
they sold to settlers, thereby raising money and increasing
business. They advertised Kansas widely. The people
 <a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a><span class="pageno">185</span>
soon found it necessary to regulate the railroads, and
created for this purpose the Railroad Commission, now
the Public Utilities Commission. Besides the various
railroad systems of the State, there are many interurban
lines and a rapidly growing motor truck service. Great
progress in road improvement is being made.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">EDUCATION IN KANSAS</h4>

<p class="p2"><strong>The First Schools in Kansas.</strong> The first schools in
Kansas were the mission schools for the Indians. When
Kansas was organized as a Territory and the white settlers
began to make their homes here, the education of their
children became one of their first interests. In the summer
of 1855 the first Territorial Legislature passed a law
providing for the establishment of common schools, and
thus laid the foundation for our public school system.</p>

<p><strong>Early Territorial Schools.</strong> In January of 1855, when
the town of Lawrence was only six months old, a school
was opened in the back of Dr. Charles Robinson’s office.
A term of school was held in Lawrence every winter thereafter.
Other towns also maintained schools, as did a few
of the country communities, but the settlers’ claims were
so widely scattered and the dangers during the days of
raids and warfare were so great that country schools were
almost an impossibility during the first few years.</p>

<p><strong>Subscription Schools.</strong> Many of the earlier schools were
“subscription schools,” which means that they were not
public schools supported by a tax levy, but that the
teacher’s pay came from a tuition charged each pupil who
attended.</p>

<p><strong>Beginning of Our School System.</strong> By 1859, when
Territorial conditions had become more settled, the Legislature
turned its attention to the matter of education and
passed a set of school laws that has served ever since as
the basis of our system of education. While Kansas was
still a Territory, a few districts were organized and schoolhouses
built, and the minimum school term was made
three months.</p>

<p><strong>Schools After the Civil War.</strong> Little educational progress
was made during the Civil War, but when peace
had come to Kansas and the people could turn their minds
to the needs of their homes and communities, schoolhouses
built of logs or sod sprang up everywhere, for the pioneers
had brought with them a desire to educate their children.
Sometimes the settlers did not even wait to organize their
district, but gathered together and began work on their
schoolhouse. Where there was a timber supply they made
their buildings of logs. On the prairie they built of sod.
With the breaking plow they sliced out long pieces of sod
from two to four inches thick and twelve to fourteen
inches wide, and these, mortared with soft mud, were used
like brick to build the walls. The roof was sometimes of
lumber, but often the sod was laid over a framework of
brush and poles. Whether the building was of logs or of sod,
the floor was usually of dirt sprinkled and packed until it
was hard and smooth. As the country grew in population
 <a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a><span class="pageno">189</span>
and resources these buildings were replaced by others made
of lumber, brick, or stone, but the little log and sod schoolhouses
served the pioneers well. They were used not only
for school purposes, but for religious services and for social
gatherings, spelling schools, singing schools, and literary
societies. The schoolhouses were the social centers in
early Kansas.</p>

<p><strong>The Work of the Pioneer Schools.</strong> Although the minimum
term was three months, it was usually made a little
longer for the benefit of the smaller children. As a rule
the older boys and girls went to school only during the
winter months when they could be spared from the farms.
The work in the schools in those days consisted chiefly of
the three R’s, “readin’, ’ritin’ and ’rithmetic.” In most
 <a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a><span class="pageno">190</span>
cases, the pupils started each year at the beginning of their
books and worked as far as they could. This was continued
winter after winter until the girls and boys were
eighteen to twenty-one years of age, or even older. There
was no such thing as graduating from the country schools;
the pupils attended until they were ready to quit. Since
there were almost no high schools in the State, few of the
children received more than a common school education,
and most of the teachers had no more than that.</p>

<p><strong>Changes in the District Schools.</strong> Conditions are quite
different in the country schools to-day. Many of them
have terms of eight months, a few have nine months, while
seven months is the shortest term permitted by the State.
The truancy law requires attendance during the full term,
whatever its length. The sod and log schoolhouses of
pioneer days were, in time, replaced by neat little box-like
buildings usually constructed of wood, though occasionally
of brick or stone, and these in turn are now rapidly disappearing
 <a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a><span class="pageno">191</span>
and their places are being taken by buildings
that are larger, more beautiful, more comfortable, and
far better adapted to educational needs. The qualifications
of teachers have been raised. In earlier days, when
there were but few high schools, many teachers had no
education beyond what they had obtained in the country
schools, but to-day ninety per cent of the rural teachers
of the State are high-school graduates, and this per cent is
steadily increasing. The work of the rural schools has
expanded far beyond the “three R’s.” In addition to the
regular work it now includes as much as time will permit
of such subjects as music, manual training, agriculture,
and household arts. The rural schools have been receiving
a great deal of attention in recent years and are
very rapidly being improved. Several hundred of them
have already met the requirements laid down by the State
for a “standard” school, and a few for a “superior”
school, and these lists are constantly growing.</p>

<p><strong>Consolidated Schools.</strong> Consolidation is generally looked
upon as a method of bettering conditions in the rural
schools. A consolidated district is one formed by the
 <a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a><span class="pageno">193</span>
union of several districts. The little district schoolhouses
are replaced by a larger building, usually centrally located,
to which the children are conveyed in wagons provided for
that purpose. With its larger valuation the consolidated
district can have plenty of teachers and equipment and
can offer a greater variety of subjects. There are a number
of consolidated schools in the State now, and the plan is
being considered in many communities. The good roads
movement will no doubt do much to encourage consolidation.</p>

<p><strong>Growth of the High School.</strong> A number of years passed
before there were many high schools in Kansas. Four
schools constituted the list of accredited high schools of
the State as published in 1876. By 1886 the number had
grown to thirty-six, and by 1896 it had reached seventy-seven.
From that time on the number increased very
rapidly until in 1918 there were six hundred thirty accredited
high schools in the State, one hundred twenty-one
of which were rural high schools. Until about 1905
the standard for an accredited high school was a course of
only three years. Since that time it has been four years.
In the early years the real purpose of the high school was
considered to be that of preparing the pupils for college,
and the courses of study included only such subjects as
were suited to that purpose. The present idea is that
this is only one of the purposes of the high school, the
other being that of supplying to the great mass of pupils,
who will never go to college, the best possible preparation
for living. To accomplish this latter purpose courses of
study have been broadened to include such work as music,
manual training, agriculture, commercial work, household
arts, teacher training, and industrial training. Until very
recent years high schools were established only in towns
and cities, but now they are to be found in consolidated
 <a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a><span class="pageno">197</span>
districts, and in rural districts, sometimes in small towns
in those districts and sometimes in communities that are
entirely rural. There is not now a county in the State
that is without a four-year accredited high school.</p>

<p><strong>Institutions of Higher Learning.</strong> The deep interest of
the Kansas settlers in matters of education is nowhere
more apparent than in their early establishment of institutions
of higher learning. In the first Constitution, made
in 1855, one reads, “The General Assembly may take
measures for the establishment of a university”; and again,
“Provisions may be made by law for the support of normal
schools.” These matters were not lost sight of, and almost
immediately after the admission of Kansas as a state this
ambition found expression in the establishment of the
Normal School, the Agricultural College, and the University.</p>

<p><strong>The Normal Schools.</strong> The State Normal School at
Emporia opened in 1865 with eighteen students enrolled.
It used the upper floor of the new schoolhouse that had
 <a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a><span class="pageno">199</span>
just been built for Emporia which was then but a small
town. There was no furniture, and the equipment consisted
of a Bible and a dictionary. Seats were borrowed
from a neighboring church. But the Normal soon had a
building of its own. In later years this has been three
times replaced by a larger and better one and many new
buildings have been added.</p>

<p>The Normal School is based on the principle that it is
not only necessary to know what to teach but how to teach;
that there are new discoveries and advances in methods of
teaching as there are in other lines, such as medicine or
farming. The purpose of the Normal School is to train
teachers.</p>

<p>When our State Normal School was established there
were not more than a dozen other such schools in the
United States and none that prepared teachers for high-school
positions. To-day there are many normal schools,
but none larger than ours or more amply equipped to prepare
 <a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a><span class="pageno">201</span>
teachers for all lines of teaching. The course of study,
reaching from the kindergarten to the completion of a
college course, places our State Normal School in the front
rank of institutions of its kind.</p>
<a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a><span class="pageno">200</span>

<p>In 1901 the Western Branch State Normal School was
established at Hays, and in 1903 another branch, the
Manual Training Normal School, was opened at Pittsburg.
Each of these has since been made an independent school.
The one at Hays is now known as the Fort Hays Kansas
Normal School.</p>

 <p class="caption"><span class="sc">Kansas State Agricultural College, Manhattan.</span></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>The Agricultural College.</strong> In 1862 Congress passed an
act providing for land grants to states for the purpose of
establishing colleges of agriculture and mechanic arts.
Kansas was among the first states to accept the endowment,
and the next year Bluemont Central College, a
Methodist school at Manhattan, was given to the State
and made the State Agricultural College. During the
first ten years the growth of the Agricultural College was
very slow. This was chiefly due to the fact that industrial
education was something new and did not receive much
attention. The College gave only a little work in agriculture
or manual training, and what was given was merely
supplementary. It was doing little to educate toward the
farm or the workshop. In 1873 the school was reorganized.
Farmers began to be interested in it and to discuss its possibilities.
Such subjects as Latin and Greek were dropped
and agriculture, home economics, and mechanic arts were
emphasized. Workshops, print shops, kitchen and sewing
rooms, agricultural implements, and live stock, were provided.
This was a very advanced step at that time and
it aroused some opposition. It was called the “new-fangled”
education, and farmers who read and studied
methods of farming were often sneered at as “book
farmers.” But in time people began to view these things
 <a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a><span class="pageno">203</span>
in a different light. It has now come to be generally
recognized that successful farming requires a broader and
more varied knowledge than almost any other business,
and that in an agricultural state like ours nothing is
more important than the training of its citizens for home
and farm life. The Agricultural College now occupies the
position of leadership in the agricultural and industrial interests
of the State, and is one of the largest agricultural
colleges in the United States.</p>

 <p class="caption"><span class="sc">The University of Kansas, Lawrence.</span></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>The University.</strong> The University of Kansas was established
by an act of the Legislature of 1864, and its object,
as given by this act, is to “provide the inhabitants of the
State with means of acquiring a thorough knowledge of the
various branches of literature, science, and the arts.”
The university idea is hundreds of years old, and so there
was nothing new in the thought of a university in Kansas.
The University of Kansas was built on the flat-topped
hill in Lawrence where the first party of free-state settlers
pitched their tents. It was opened in 1866 with forty
students and three professors. To-day there are twenty
great buildings on Mount Oread. The central department
of the University is the college, which provides a liberal
education in languages, sciences, mathematics, history,
and kindred subjects. Besides the college there are schools
of engineering, of fine arts, of law, of pharmacy, of medicine,
and of education. Ours now ranks high among the
universities of the United States.</p>

<p><strong>Control of State Schools.</strong> Altogether, the University,
the Agricultural College, and the Normal Schools employ
about seven hundred instructors and enroll between eight
and nine thousand students each year. The total annual
cost to the people of Kansas is nearly two million dollars.
These schools, together with the School for the Blind at
Kansas City, and the School for the Deaf at Olathe,
 <a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a><span class="pageno">204</span>
were, in 1913, placed under the management of a board
of three members called the Board of Administration.
In 1917 the Board of Administration was reorganized and
the penal and the charitable institutions of the State were
placed under its control.</p>

<p><strong>Denominational Colleges.</strong> In addition to the State
institutions Kansas has more than thirty denominational
colleges. A few of the largest of these are Baker University
at Baldwin, Washburn College at Topeka, Ottawa University
at Ottawa, Friends University at Wichita, the
Southwestern University at Winfield, and the College of
Emporia. There are also a number of business colleges
and a few independent schools.</p>

<p><strong>Other Provisions for Education.</strong> Besides all the schools
where the people of Kansas may obtain an education,
every effort is being made to provide other educational
opportunities by means of extension work, public and
traveling libraries, and night schools. The State Normal
School, the Agricultural College, and the University all
do extension work, which means that they offer correspondence
courses, send out lecturers, and in various other
ways carry their work to those who can not attend the
schools. Many communities maintain free public libraries
and the State maintains a traveling library.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_20" id="fnanchor_20"></a><a href="#footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></span> Night
schools are now provided in several of our larger cities.
An education is now possible to any one who really
wants it.</p>
<a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a><span class="pageno">205</span>

<p>All of this has been brought about within little more
than a half century, and though there is much yet to be
done the people of Kansas have every reason to be proud
of what they have accomplished in the interests of education.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">SUMMARY</p>

<p class="blockquote">Education in Kansas began with the mission schools
and was one of the first interests in Territorial days. There
were many subscription schools before district schools
were organized. The organization of districts began in
the Territorial period and kept pace with settlement.
The University, the Normal School and the Agricultural
College were established during the Civil War. Since that
time many denominational colleges have been established,
the high school has been developed, and many other
means of education have been provided. Great educational
progress has been made.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">KANSAS MEMORIALS</h4>

<p class="p2"><strong>Significance of Kansas History.</strong> Kansas is a comparatively
new State. Nearly all of its history has been made
within little more than a century, and most of it within
the sixty years of its period of settlement. Few states,
however, have had a more eventful history. From its
beginning Kansas has been a place of action. The pages
of its history are filled with wars and battles, with stirring
adventure, and with deeds of courage and daring. Nearly
every part of the State has its places of historic interest,
and the names of men and women who should be honored
for good and brave deeds would make a long list.</p>

<p>The people of Kansas are proud of the history of their
State and desire to preserve it. To that end they have
taken steps to save a number of the old landmarks, they
have built many monuments, and have gathered and kept
many records of the past.</p>

<p><strong>Pawnee Rock.</strong> One of the early landmarks was Pawnee
Rock on the old Santa Fe Trail, in what is now Barton
County. This giant rock standing on the level plain was
a noted spot, for the Trail ran near its base, and while it
provided a place of rest and safety for many a weary
traveler, it also afforded a retreat from which the Indians
could dash down upon the traders. In later years much
of the rock was torn away for building purposes and this
historic old landmark was rapidly disappearing. The
Woman’s Kansas Day Club resolved to save this historic
spot, and secured a deed for the Rock and five acres of
ground surrounding it. On Kansas Day, 1909, the women
presented this deed to the State. The transfer was made
with the condition that the State spend $3000 for improvements.
 <a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a><span class="pageno">209</span>
This was done and the preservation of
Pawnee Rock is now assured.</p>

<p><strong>The Pike Memorial.</strong> The exact site of the Pawnee
Indian village visited by Lieutenant Pike in 1806 was not
known with certainty for many years, but was finally
found to be in Republic County. It was located through
the discovery of rows of circular ridges supposed to have
been the embankments of the Indian lodges.<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_21" id="fnanchor_21"></a><a href="#footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></span> An iron
fence now incloses about six acres of the ground, on which
the rings are still plainly visible, and a granite shaft stands
where the Stars and Stripes first floated over Kansas.
The monument bears the inscription: “Erected by the
State of Kansas, 1901, to mark the site of the Pawnee
Republic where Lieutenant Zebulon M. Pike caused the
Spanish flag to be lowered and the flag of the United
States to be raised, September 29, 1806.”</p>

<p><strong>Marking of the Santa Fe Trail.</strong> The Santa Fe Trail,
which was associated with most of the early history of Kansas,
was known throughout the country, but with the
settlement of the State the old highway was growing
dim; the ruts were filling in,
grass was covering the broad
track, and with the passing of
those who knew it in the old
days the true route was in danger
of being forgotten. To prevent
this, the Daughters of the American
Revolution began, in the
opening years of the present century,
to agitate the question of
marking the line of the Trail
through the State. In 1905 the
Legislature appropriated $1000
“for procuring suitable monuments
for this purpose.” Kansas
Day of 1906 was designated
“Trail Day” in the public schools,
and the children were invited to
contribute a penny each toward
the fund. They gave $584.40.
Eighty-nine markers were purchased. Various local organizations
added nine more, making a total of ninety-eight
markers. They were placed along the Trail from
the eastern to the western end of the State. They bear
the inscription, “Santa Fe Trail 1822-1872. Marked by
the Daughters of the American Revolution and the State
of Kansas, 1906.” A few of the markers bear special inscriptions
in addition to this. The one at Council Grove
has on the other side, “On this spot, August 10, 1825, the
 <a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"></a><span class="pageno">211</span>
treaty was made with the
Osage Indians for the right
of way of the Santa Fe Trail.”</p>

<p><strong>Pawnee Capitol.</strong> The old
stone building erected at
Pawnee for the capitol of
Kansas still stands on the Fort
Riley Reservation. In 1907 a
subscription fund was raised
and the money used to repair
and restore the old building
so that it will stand for many
years as a relic of our early
history.</p>

<p><strong>John Brown’s Battle Field.</strong>
The site of John Brown’s
battle field at Osawatomie
was purchased by the Woman’s Relief Corps of Kansas
and presented to the State in 1909.</p>

<p><strong>Statues in the Hall of Fame.</strong> Each State is permitted
to place two statues in the Hall of Fame in the National
Capitol at Washington. In 1905 one of the Kansas
places was filled with a statue
of John J. Ingalls, who was
a Senator from this State
from 1873 to 1891. In 1913
the other place was filled
with a statue of George W.
Glick, who was Governor
of Kansas from 1883 to 1885.</p>

<p><strong>Other Monuments.</strong> A
number of monuments have
been erected in various parts
of the State in commemoration
 <a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a><span class="pageno">212</span>
of noted persons or events. The John Brown monument
at Osawatomie was dedicated on August 30, 1877. It bears
two inscriptions: “In commemoration of those who, on
the 30th of August, 1856, gave up their lives at the battle
of Osawatomie in defense of freedom,” and, “This inscription
is also in commemoration of the heroism of Captain
John Brown, who commanded at the battle of Osawatomie,
August 30, 1856; who died and conquered American slavery
on the scaffold at Charlestown, Virginia, December
2, 1859.”</p>

<p>At Lawrence there is a monument bearing this inscription:
“Dedicated to the memory of the one hundred and
 <a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a><span class="pageno">213</span>
fifty citizens who, defenseless, fell victims
to the inhuman ferocity of border guerrillas,
led by the infamous Quantrill in his
raid upon Lawrence, August 21, 1863.
Erected May 30, 1895.”</p>

<p>A monument has been raised near
Junction City in honor of the expedition
of Coronado. There are several other
monuments in the State commemorating
the Spanish explorations of 1541-1542.</p>

<p>Monuments have been dedicated to
the memory of settlers killed in the Indian
raids on the frontier, and to men
who were killed by Indians while engaged
in construction work on the Union Pacific
Railroad.</p>

<p><strong>Memorial Hall.</strong> These are only a few;
many tablets, monuments, and markers
have been erected in Kansas, but by far the greatest
number of them are monuments in honor of the soldiers
of the Civil War. Many of these are
very handsome, and they have cost,
in the aggregate, thousands of dollars;
but this recognition seemed
insufficient, and it had long been
hoped that a handsome and serviceable
building might be erected as a
fitting and worthy recognition by the
whole State of the honor due the soldiers
and sailors of the Civil War.
The fulfillment of this ambition
finally became possible when the
United States paid to Kansas an old
Civil War debt amounting to nearly
 <a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a><span class="pageno">214</span>
a half-million dollars. The money was used for the
construction of Memorial Hall. This beautiful structure,
built of white marble, stands near the grounds of the
State Capitol at Topeka. Part of Memorial Hall is used
as headquarters for the Kansas Department of the
Grand Army of the Republic, and the rest by the
State Historical Society.</p>

the blade, in Spanish, are the words: “Draw me not without reason; sheathe me not
without honor.”</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>The State Historical Society.</strong> The State Historical Society
was organized in 1875. From that time until the
present the Society has gathered and kept books, writings,
narratives, maps, relics and other matter relating to the
history of Kansas. In these collections may be found information
concerning the explorations, the Indians, the
overland travel, the settlements, and the condition and
progress of the State in its various departments. Volumes
 <a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a><span class="pageno">215</span>
of clippings, files of newspapers, and thousands of books,
provide a very complete record of all phases of the State’s
history. One of the interesting features is the collection
of relics, among which are: an old Spanish sword supposed
to have belonged to one of Coronado’s soldiers; the pistol
of the Jayhawker, James Montgomery; two cannon used
in the border troubles; and the cap, saddle, and sword of
John Brown. There are many Indian pipes, ornaments,
implements, arrowheads, and a war bonnet. The historical
collections, which have increased from year to
year, are very interesting and should be seen by every
citizen of Kansas. The Historical Society had rooms in
the State Capitol until the completion of Memorial Hall,
when it was moved into the new building. Thus Memorial
Hall stands as a tribute not only to the soldiers but to the
entire history of Kansas.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">SUMMARY</p>

<p class="blockquote">In late years Kansas has taken many steps to preserve
its history. Some of its most prominent memorials are:
Pawnee Rock; Pike Memorial; Santa Fe Trail markers;
Pawnee Capitol; John Brown’s battle-field; monuments
to commemorate the battle of Osawatomie, the Marais
des Cygnes massacre, and the Quantrill raid. Many other
monuments and tablets have been erected in different
parts of the State to commemorate important events.
Memorial Hall, completed in 1914, was built in honor of
the soldiers and sailors who served in the Civil War.
 <a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a><span class="pageno">216</span>
This building provided fitting quarters for the Kansas
Department of the Grand Army of the Republic, and for
the State Historical Society which has a large and valuable
collection of original historical material.</p>

<h4 class="h4head">THE KANSAS SPIRIT</h4>

<p class="p2"><strong>Introduction.</strong> Kansas is a great State; great in size and
wealth, great in industries and resources, and great in
what it has accomplished. But there are states that are
larger, others that are wealthier, and many that have
larger cities, greater population, a longer history, and
more splendid memorials, so it is not for these things that
Kansas is especially noted among the states. The quality
that is the mark of its distinction is the character of its
history and of its people.</p>

<p><strong>The Meaning of the Kansas Spirit.</strong> Any people is, in
large part, the product of its thinking, its beliefs, and its
hopes and desires. This is the lesson of Hawthorne’s story,
“The Great Stone Face.” Through all the years Ernest
studied the face on the mountain and pondered the
thoughts that he read there. In time he came to resemble
the great face, both in its features and in the character it
expressed. In the same way the people of Kansas have
become what they are to-day because of their thoughts,
their experiences and their ideals. We often hear it said
concerning some act or some effort toward progress, “That
is the Kansas spirit,” which means that the thing done
shows what kind of people the Kansans are; it is characteristic
of them. If, then, we would understand what this
Kansas spirit is, we must know what thoughts and experiences
and ideals have had a part in producing it.</p>

pale into insignificance before the completed glory
of the century to come.”</p>

<p class="p0 right muchsmaller">&mdash;<span class="sc">John J. Ingalls.</span></p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->

<p><strong>Pioneer Qualities.</strong> Certain characteristics of the people
of Kansas are largely due to the fact that this was so
recently a frontier state. Pioneer life, wherever it exists,
develops the qualities of independence, courage, resourcefulness,
endurance, and democracy. The pioneer has only
 <a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a><span class="pageno">219</span>
himself to lean on; he learns to take chances, he laughs at

<p><strong>Qualities that Make the Kansas Spirit.</strong> These characteristics
are not, however, peculiar to the Kansas people,
for the early settlers of other states lived on the frontier
and developed these same qualities. But Kansas had a
Territorial history which was very different from that of
any other state and which has left its impress upon the
people. Other pioneers have had the great task of making
a state out of a wilderness, but Kansas pioneers had a
second great task, that of making a free state in the face
of the most determined opposition. They came to Kansas
as the Puritans came to America, in the name of liberty.
They were stern, unyielding, purposeful men and women,
sure of the presence of divine leadership, and their character
 <a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a><span class="pageno">220</span>
has deeply influenced the Kansas people. This influence
has made them hate oppression; it has made them
demand justice and fair play; it has made them value
people for their personal worth; it has made them believe
in the equality of human rights, and in the ability of the
people to govern themselves. These are characteristics
of every true Kansan and the qualities that make the
Kansas spirit.</p>

<p><strong>Manifestations of the Kansas Spirit.</strong> This spirit is
evident in many phases of the life and progress of our
people, but it is nowhere more apparent than in their
political affairs and in their laws. The spirit that made
the pioneers refuse to submit to the “Bogus Legislature”
also impelled them to send more than their share of soldiers
to the Civil War. Later, the same spirit led the Kansas
people to adopt the prohibition amendment and to grant
to women the full right of suffrage. It caused the farmers
and other laboring people to form organizations for the
better protection of their rights. It made the State do its
part in the World War cheerfully and generously. In
short, the Kansas spirit has manifested itself whenever
the people have made an effort to overcome difficulties,
whenever they have tried to secure more justice or liberty
for themselves. These efforts have sometimes been so
radical, and the plans offered for the betterment of conditions
so new and startling as to attract much attention
in the rest of the country. But Kansas has continued to
believe in the worth and possibilities of her people and to
make every effort to bring about conditions that will give
them the opportunity to rise to the full measure of their
nature.</p>

<p><strong>The Task Confronting the Kansas of To-day.</strong> All over
the United States there is a growing tendency on the part
of the people to exercise a more direct control of their
 <a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a><span class="pageno">221</span>
government; to take more and more authority into their
own hands. This means that the people must be interested,
active and well-informed. For us, it means that
the quality of Kansas government depends upon the quality
of Kansas citizenship. While the task of the pioneers
was a heavy one, ours to-day is no less great, though it is
different. Their struggle was to get the soil under cultivation,
ours to see that it does not become worn out;
theirs to get public utilities, ours to use and regulate them;
theirs to develop new industries, ours to see that they are
carried on with justice to all; theirs to establish schools,
ours to make them more efficient; in general, theirs to
build up, ours to use wisely.</p>

<p>Kansas history is not made; it is in the making. We
study the past that we may learn how to make the present
better. Great things have been accomplished but there
is much yet to be done. The pioneers solved their problems,
and if we are worthy of the Kansas they have given
us we will strive to solve ours. We will keep alive the
Kansas spirit.</p>

<p class="p2 center ls">SUMMARY</p>

<p class="blockquote">The Kansas people have developed the same pioneer
qualities as have the people of other states; but, in addition,
their peculiar Territorial history has made them
believe in a marked degree in liberty, justice, equality,
and democracy. These characteristics have given rise to
what is called “the Kansas spirit.” This spirit is especially
evident in the political movements through which the
people have taken more and more of the control of government
into their own hands.</p>

<p class="center"><strong>TERRITORIAL PERIOD</strong></p>

<p class="p2 center"><strong>Legislatures</strong></p>

<p>There were six Territorial legislatures. The first two were proslavery.
Beginning in 1858 the four that followed were free-state.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><strong>Constitutions</strong></p>

<p>Four constitutions were prepared: the Topeka Constitution in
1855, the Lecompton in 1857, the Leavenworth in 1858, and the
Wyandotte in 1859. The Lecompton was the only one that provided
for slavery. The State was admitted under the Wyandotte, our
present Constitution. It was based on the constitution of Ohio and
was drafted by men from both parties.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><strong>Capitals</strong></p>

<p>Several different places served as Territorial capitals. When
Governor Reeder came to Kansas he kept his office at Leavenworth
for about two months, then removed it to Shawnee Mission, which
was used as the Territorial capital until the following spring when
Governor Reeder named Pawnee as the capital. The Legislature
remained at Pawnee only five days and then adjourned to Shawnee
Mission, where the Governor’s office was kept another year. In
August, 1855, the Territorial Legislature selected Lecompton, which
continued as the capital during the remainder of the Territorial
period. However, when the free-state people gained control of the
Legislature in 1858 they made an effort to change the capital to
Minneola. Failing in this, they met at Lecompton for each session
and then at once adjourned to Lawrence. At an election in November,
1861, the people selected Topeka as the permanent capital of
Kansas.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><strong>The Topeka Movement</strong></p>

<p>The free-state Government under the Topeka Constitution was
organized in the days of the “Bogus Legislature” for the purpose of
uniting the free-state people and enabling them to oppose proslavery
methods. It was continued until the free-state people gained
control of the Territorial Legislature, when it became no longer
necessary and was dropped. The principal events were as follows:
The convention met in October of 1855, completed the Topeka
Constitution in November, and the free-state people voted favorably
on it in December. In January of 1856 they elected Charles Robinson
governor. Their Legislature met in March, and in the same
month they applied for admission to the Union but the bill failed
 <a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a><span class="pageno">224</span>
to pass. The Legislature met again in July, but was disbanded by
United States troops under Sumner. They met in January of 1857,
but the officers were arrested. Two additional meetings were held;
one in January and one in March of 1858. Then, having served its
purpose, the Topeka movement was at an end.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><strong>INDIAN MISSIONS IN EARLY KANSAS</strong></p>

<p class="p2 center"><strong>Presbyterian Missions</strong></p>

<p>Two Presbyterian missions were established among the Osages
in what is now Neosho County in 1824. One was the Boudinot
mission. The work was in charge of Rev. Benton Pixley.</p>

<p>Rev. S. M. Irwin established a mission among the Iowas, Sacs
and Foxes in Doniphan County, near the present town of Highland,
in 1837. Highland College, one of the oldest colleges in the State,
still remains as a school of this church.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><strong>Methodist Missions</strong></p>

<p>In 1830 the Shawnee Methodist mission was established a few
miles southwest of where Kansas City now stands. This mission
was in charge of Rev. Thomas Johnson. A few years later it had
a manual-labor school and a farm and was one of the largest and
best known of the missions in Kansas.</p>

<p>In 1832 a mission was established among the Delawares in
Wyandotte County, on the site of the town of White Church, by
William Johnson and Thomas B. Markham. Rev. E. T. Peery was
in charge.</p>

<p>A mission for the Kickapoos was founded in 1833. It was just
north of the site of Leavenworth and was in charge of Rev. J. C.
Berryman.</p>

<p>In 1833 a mission was established for the Kanzas at Mission
Creek, Shawnee County, by Rev. William Johnson, who continued
the work for seven years. When the Kanzas were moved, the mission
was located at Council Grove. It existed from 1850 to 1854.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><strong>Baptist Missions</strong></p>

<p>The Baptist Church established a mission among the Shawnees
in 1831. It was about two miles northwest of the Shawnee Methodist
mission. The leader was Isaac McCoy, and he was joined later
by Dr. Johnson Lykins and Rev. Jotham Meeker. Mr. Meeker was
a printer, and in 1834 issued the first book printed in Kansas, a
primer in the Indian language.</p>

<p>A mission was established among the Ottawas in 1837, on the
present site of Ottawa, under the charge of Rev. Jotham Meeker.
This mission survives in Ottawa University.</p>

<p>A mission was opened among the Pottawatomies in 1837, by
Rev. Robert Simmerwell, near the site of Osawatomie. When this
tribe moved to the new reservation the mission was relocated at
Mission Creek in Shawnee County. It was abandoned in 1854.</p>

<p>In 1840 Dr. David Lykins established a mission among the
Miamis, about ten miles southeast of the present city of Paola.</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson Lykins opened a mission among the Delawares in
     1832.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><strong>Friends Mission</strong></p>

<p>The Society of Friends established a mission among the Shawnees
in 1834, about three miles west of the Methodist mission. Henry
 <a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a><span class="pageno">226</span>
Harvey, M. Mendenhall, and the Hadleys were teachers in this
mission.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><strong>Catholic Missions</strong></p>

<p>In 1822 Father La Croix visited the Osages, just across the line
in Missouri, and baptized several Indian children. At different
times Father Van Quickenborn visited the Osages and preached.
In 1847 Rev. Schoenmaker established the Osage Mission, now
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul, in Neosho County.</p>

<p>The Catholic mission was founded in 1836 by Fathers Van
Quickenborn and Hœken for the Kickapoos, near the Junction of
Salt Creek with the Missouri, in Leavenworth County.</p>

<p><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary’s mission among the Pottawatomies was established
in Miami County in 1838, and moved to Linn County in 1839,
where it remained until the removal of the tribe to Pottawatomie
County in 1849. The mission was then established at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary’s,
where it survives to-day in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary’s school for boys.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><strong>FORTS IN EARLY KANSAS</strong></p>

<p>Many forts were established in early Kansas; a few by the fur
companies, some by the War Department, some by state troops,
a number by settlers as a place of refuge from the Indians, and a
few by free-state and proslavery forces during the Territorial struggle.
Some of them consisted merely of a wall of earth thrown up,
others of a strongly built log cabin within a line of earthworks or
line of palisades. Many of them were more pretentious, and were
built of logs, adobe, or stone. Some of the forts established by the
National Government cost many thousands of dollars and most of
them had large land reserves. As the settlements moved westward
the necessity for the forts no longer existed, and with the exception
of Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley, which are still maintained by
the National Government as army posts, they fell into disuse.
The principal early forts were:</p>

<p>Fort Kanzas, established by the French fur traders in the early
part of the eighteenth century, was located in what is now Atchison
County. It is mentioned in the journal of Lewis and Clark as an
abandoned fort.</p>

<p>Fort Lyon, earlier called Bent’s Fort, was built in 1826 for a
fur-trading post. It occupied several different sites on the Arkansas
River, all of them within the present bounds of Colorado, the last
one being within Territorial Kansas. It was opened to settlement
in 1890.</p>

<p>Fort Leavenworth was established in 1827 by Col. Henry Leavenworth
of the United States army. It has from its beginning been
an important military post. More than $2,000,000 has been expended
on it, and it now ranks among the first of the military posts
of the United States.</p>

<p>Fort Riley was established in 1852 by the United States. It has
been enlarged and improved from time to time until it is now an
important military center. Fort Riley is near the junction of the
Republican and Smoky Hill rivers, and is very near the geographical
center of the United States.</p>

<p>Fort Atkinson, one of the early forts erected along the Santa Fe
Trail, was located on the Arkansas River about six miles above the
present site of Dodge City. This fort was built in 1850 and abandoned
in 1854. It was known for a few months as Fort Mackey,
when the name was changed to Fort Atkinson.</p>

<p>Fort Mann was probably erected about 1845 on or near the site
on which Fort Atkinson was later built.</p>

<p>Fort Scott was built in 1842 on the site of the present city of
Fort Scott. In 1853 it ceased to be used as a military post, and in
1855 the buildings were sold. This fort had no reservation.</p>

<p>Fort Larned was located in 1859 on Pawnee Fork, about eight
miles above the mouth of that stream. It was for a number of years
an important post, but was later abandoned as a fort, and in 1882
the reservation was opened for sale to settlers.</p>

<p>Fort Saunders was a proslavery stronghold about twelve miles
 <a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a><span class="pageno">228</span>
southwest of Lawrence in 1856. It was destroyed by a body of free-state
settlers the same year.</p>

<p>Fort Titus, located about two miles south of Lecompton, was a
log house used as a proslavery fortification. It was captured and
destroyed by free-state forces shortly after the destruction of Fort
Saunders.</p>

<p>Fort Wakarusa was a free-state fortification on the Wakarusa
River, about five miles from Lawrence.</p>

<p>Fort Bain was a log cabin in the northern part of Bourbon County
which served as a retreat for John Brown and James Montgomery
in 1857 and 1858.</p>

<p>Fort Baxter, a military post, was established by General Blunt
in 1863. It was the scene of an attack by Quantrill, known as the
Baxter Springs massacre. After the war the town of Baxter Springs
grew up on the site.</p>

<p>Fort Dodge was one of the most important forts on the western
frontier. It was located to the east of The Caches, near Dodge
City, in 1864. The first buildings were of adobe, but in 1867 good
buildings were erected. Fort Dodge was not abandoned until 1882.
The Soldiers’ Home at Fort Dodge was later established on a part
of this military reservation.</p>

<p>Fort Downer was located on Downer’s Creek, about fifty miles
west of Fort Hays. It was in existence between 1863 and 1868.</p>

<p>Fort Harker was established in 1864, near the present site of
Ellsworth, with the name Fort Ellsworth. Two years later the
name was changed to Fort Harker and the site moved about a mile
northeast. This fort was for a long time the shipping point for
freight bound for New Mexico. Fort Harker was abandoned in
1872 and the reservation opened to settlement in 1880.</p>

<p>Fort Wallace was established near the present town of Wallace
in 1865. This was an important post during the building of the
Union Pacific railroad. It was abandoned as a fort in 1882, and in
1888 the land was ordered sold.</p>

<p>Fort Zarah was established in 1864, about four miles east of the
present city of Great Bend. It was dismantled in 1869, and the
reservation was later sold.</p>

<p>Fort Hays was established by the National Government, in 1865,
about fourteen miles southeast of the present Hays City, and was
for a year known as Fort Fletcher. In 1867 a new site, about three-fourths
mile from Hays City, was selected. The reservation consisted
of 7500 acres. General Sheridan used Fort Hays for headquarters
during the Black Kettle raid in 1868. It continued to be
used as a military post until 1889. In 1900 Kansas secured the land
and buildings for educational purposes. The Fort Hays Kansas
Normal School and an experiment station for the Agricultural
College are now located there.</p>

<p>Fort Henning, Fort Blair, and Fort Insley were three blockhouses
erected at Fort Scott in 1861 for the purpose of guarding
military stores from the Confederate forces.</p>

<p>Fort Lincoln was built by Lane in 1861, about twelve miles northwest
 <a name="Page_229" id="Page_229"></a><span class="pageno">229</span>
of Fort Scott, for protection from the Confederate forces. It
was abandoned in 1864.</p>

<p>Fort Aubrey was one of the forts established in 1865 by the
soldiers sent to quell the Indian uprisings. It was located near the
present village of Mayline in Hamilton County. It was abandoned
the following year.</p>

<p>Fort Jewell was erected in 1870 on the site of Jewell City for the
protection of the settlers against the Cheyennes who were then on
the warpath. It consisted of a wall of earth around a fifty-yard
square. After the Indian troubles were over Fort Jewell was abandoned.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><strong>SOME PROMINENT KANSANS</strong></p>

<p>Hundreds of Kansas men and women have served their State
in a way worthy of note. To tell the story of the services rendered
by all of them would require many volumes. In a book like the
present one, mention can be made of only a few of those most widely
known. In addition to names mentioned in the body of the text,
the following are a few of the names of Kansans, no longer living,
who had much to do with making the history of the State:</p>

<p><span class="sc">Preston B. Plumb</span> came to Kansas to make his home in 1857.
He started a newspaper, <cite>Kansas News</cite>, at Emporia. In 1861 he
was elected to the State House of Representatives. The same year
he entered the Union army and served until the close of the war.
He then engaged in the practice of law. In 1876 he was elected to
the United States Senate, which position he filled until his death in
1891, a period of fourteen years of continuous service.</p>

<p><span class="sc">William A. Harris</span> came to Kansas in 1865, at the close of four
years of service in the Confederate army, and entered the employ
of the Union Pacific Railroad Company as a civil engineer. Later
he became a well-known farmer and stock raiser. In 1896 he was
elected to the State Senate, and in 1897 to the United States Senate.
His later years were given to various lines of agricultural advancement.
He served as a regent of the State Agricultural College. His
death occurred in 1909.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Samuel A. Kingman</span> came to Kansas in 1857. He was a lawyer.
He served as a member of the Wyandotte Constitutional Convention.
He was associate justice of the Supreme Court of Kansas,
1861 to 1865, and chief justice, 1867 to 1876, when he resigned
because of ill health. He died in 1904.</p>

<p><span class="sc">David J. Brewer</span> came to Leavenworth in 1859, where he engaged
in the practice of law. He served continuously in various
offices. He was associate justice of the State Supreme Court from
1871 to 1884, a judge of the United States Circuit Court from 1884
to 1889, and in 1889 he was commissioned Associate Justice of the
United States Supreme Court, which position he filled until his
death in 1910.</p>

<p><span class="sc">John A. Anderson</span> came to Junction City in 1858 as pastor of
the Presbyterian church. In 1873 he was made president of the
State Agricultural College. He reorganized that institution and
remained at its head until 1878, when he was elected to Congress
where he served until 1891. He was appointed consul-general to
Cairo, Egypt, in 1891. He died on his way back home in the following
year.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Francis Huntington Snow</span> was elected to the first faculty of
the University of Kansas as professor of mathematics and natural
sciences, in 1866. In 1870 he became professor of natural history in
the University. He organized the collecting expeditions which have
resulted in the extensive natural history museums of the University.
He was made Chancellor of the University in 1890, from which
position he retired in 1901. He died in 1908.</p>
<a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a><span class="pageno">231</span>

<p><span class="sc">Edmund G. Ross</span> came to Kansas in 1856. He was a member of
the Wyandotte Constitutional Convention and served in the Union
army. In 1866 he was appointed to fill the vacancy in the United
States Senate caused by the death of James H. Lane. He cast the
deciding vote in the Senate against the impeachment of President
Johnson, which act aroused great indignation. He engaged in newspaper
work until 1882, when he went to New Mexico where he
served as Territorial Governor from 1885 to 1889. He died in 1907.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. C. I. H. Nichols</span>, a writer and lecturer, came with her
family to Kansas in 1854. She lived first at Lawrence and then at
Wyandotte. She was a strong advocate of a more just understanding
of the rights of women. She attended the meetings of the Wyandotte
Constitutional Convention, and counseled with the members
on all matters relating to women, with the result that the Kansas
Constitution was one of the most liberal in the United States at that
time. Her death occurred in 1885.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Mary A. Bickerdyke</span>, generally known as “Mother
Bickerdyke,” served as a nurse during the Civil War. At its close
she came to Kansas and was instrumental in assisting soldiers who
were left without employment to come to Kansas and take homesteads.
Through her efforts aid was given settlers after Indian raids,
and she assisted in securing aid for Kansas settlers after the grasshopper
invasion. The Mother Bickerdyke Home for soldiers’
widows, at Ellsworth, was named in her honor. After a life of great
activity she died in 1901.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Alfred Gray</span> came to Kansas in 1857. With the exception of
his period of service in the Union army he was engaged in farming
until 1873. From 1866 until 1870 he was a director of the State
Agricultural Society. When the State Board of Agriculture was
organized, in 1872, he became its first secretary, and filled the position
until his death in 1880.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Frederick Wellhouse</span> came to Leavenworth County, Kansas,
in 1859. He was engaged in the growing and sale of fruit trees until
1876, when he began planting commercial apple orchards. During
the next eighteen years he planted 1637 acres of apple trees. Many
years were given to experiments to determine the varieties best
adapted to Kansas. He became known throughout the country,
and was called “The Apple King.” For ten years he was president
of the State Horticultural Society, and was at different times engaged
in many public activities. He died in 1911.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Franklin G. Adams</span> settled on a farm in Leavenworth County
in 1856. He held various positions of public service, and on the
organization of the State Historical Society in 1875 he was made its
secretary, which position he held until his death in 1899. He
organized and developed the work of the Society, in which work
he was materially assisted by his daughter, Miss Zu Adams, who
continued her work from 1880 until her death in 1911.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mrs. Sara T. D. Robinson</span> came to the Territory in 1854 with
her husband, Dr. Charles Robinson, and took an active part in
early Kansas affairs. She wrote Kansas&mdash;&#8203;Its Interior and Exterior
 <a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a><span class="pageno">232</span>
Life, the most notable book produced by a Kansan of that time.
It had a wide circulation and a great influence. Mrs. Robinson
died at her home near Lawrence in 1911.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Noble L. Prentis</span> came to Kansas in 1869 as editor of the <cite>Topeka
Record</cite>. From that time until his death in 1900 he was connected
with various Kansas newspapers: the <cite>Topeka Commonwealth</cite>, the
<cite>Lawrence Journal</cite>, the <cite>Junction City Union</cite>, the <cite>Atchison Champion</cite>,
and the <cite>Kansas City Star</cite>. He wrote five books: A Kansan Abroad,
Southern Letters, Southwestern Letters, Kansas Miscellanies, and
History of Kansas.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Daniel W. Wilder</span>, who first came to Kansas in 1857, was at
different times the editor of a number of newspapers. He was one
of the founders of the State Historical Society, served one term as
state auditor and two terms as superintendent of insurance. It was
as a newspaper man that Mr. Wilder’s influence was especially felt.
He was the author of the Annals of Kansas, Life of Shakespeare,
and was one of the compilers of all editions of Bartlett’s Familiar
Quotations.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Eugene F. Ware</span> came to Kansas in 1867. He practiced law,
and was for many years the editor of the <cite>Fort Scott Monitor</cite>. He
served in the state legislature, and from 1902 to 1905 was United

<p class="p2 center"><strong>KANSAS WRITERS</strong></p>

<p>The Kansas struggle was the source of a great deal of writing.
Eastern newspapers were full of the Kansas question. During the
Territorial period many of the eastern papers kept correspondents
in the Territory, and these men wrote much of the conflict here and
of pioneer life and conditions. The Kansas people themselves were
too busy to give much attention to literature and produced but few
writings of permanent value. Kansas&mdash;&#8203;Its Interior and Exterior
Life, by Mrs. Sara T. D. Robinson, was written during this period.
Other early writers were: William A. Phillips, Richard Realf,
James Redpath, Albert D. Richardson, W. P. Tomlinson, and Henry
Harvey.</p>

<p>During the Civil War practically all of the writing produced in
Kansas was concerned with the struggle that the people were going
through. The period from the close of the Civil War until the
“grasshopper year” of 1874 was one of remarkable growth and
expansion and the people were full of confidence and enthusiasm.
It was in this period that <cite>The Kansas Magazine</cite> was published.
Though it lasted less than two years, it was a magazine of real
literature. Among the contributors were: Henry King, James W.
Steele, John J. Ingalls, D. W. Wilder, R. J. Hinton, Charles Robinson,
and Noble L. Prentis.</p>

<p>The depression caused by the grasshopper raid affected Kansas
in literature as well as in other activities. For several years but few
books were published. Two of the books produced during this
period were, however, very valuable ones: Andreas’ History of
Kansas, a compilation by many writers, and Wilder’s Annals of
Kansas. George R. Peck and John J. Ingalls came into prominence
about this time as orators. Many of their speeches have become
a part of our literature. Joseph G. McCoy and Joel Moody were
writers of this period.</p>

<p>A number of good books were published in the ’80’s, among them:
The Story of a Country Town, E. W. Howe; A Kansan Abroad,
Noble L. Prentis; Rhymes of Ironquill, Eugene F. Ware; History
of Kansas, L. W. Spring; Anabel and Other Poems, Ellen P. Allerton.
Other writers of this time were: F. W. Giles, Charles Gleed, and
Hattie Horner.</p>

<p>The period following the collapse of the boom, 1888 to 1892, produced
many books. Some of the most prominent were: Kansas
Miscellanies, Prentis; The Farmers’ Side, William A. Peffer; Letters,
Charles F. Scott; In the Van of Empire, Henry Inman; Richard
Bruce, Charles M. Sheldon; Old Wine in New Bottles, Brinton W.
Woodward. During this period <cite>The Agora</cite>, a Kansas magazine, was
published. All the best Kansas writers of the period were among its
contributors, but it lived only a short time. Among other writers
were: Nathaniel S. Goss, Mrs. Mary W. Hudson, Gov. Charles
Robinson, Albert Bigelow Paine, and John Speer.</p>

<p>The last twenty years have brought peace and prosperity to
Kansas and the people have been able to give more time and

<p class="p2 center"><strong>TERRITORIAL OFFICERS OF KANSAS</strong></p>

<p>The Governors were appointed for terms of four years, but none
of them served a full term. Ten different men filled the office during
the Territorial period of six years and eight months. There were six
Governors and five Acting Governors, James W. Denver serving in
both capacities. During the absence of a Governor or when there
was a vacancy in the office the duties of the Governor fell upon the
Secretary of the Territory and he was called the Acting Governor.</p>

 In 1819 the United States gave to Spain that part of Kansas
lying south of the Arkansas River and west of the 100th meridian.
This territory again became a part of the United States by the
annexation of Texas in 1845.</p>

 A cache was made by digging a jug-shaped hole in the ground
and lining it with dry grass, or sticks, or anything to keep out moisture.
Then the goods were packed in and the opening closed very
carefully by replacing the sod and carrying away the earth that was
removed, so that no sign was left by which the cache might be discovered.
Sometimes a camp fire was built over it to destroy all
traces of the cache.</p>

 Another phenomenon that makes the traveler in a dry or
desert country afraid to trust his eyes is the mirage. He often sees
what seem to be lakes, trees, buildings, cities, only to find on nearer
approach that they all disappear. As Kansas has come under cultivation
the mirage has become less frequent, but it is still seen in the
western part of the State. Here is a description of one seen in early
Kansas:</p>

<p class="footnote">“On approaching the town of Lerny, about a mile and a quarter
this side, we found the whole intermediate space between us and the
grove of trees beyond the town apparently occupied by a beautiful
lake. On the apparent shore next to ourselves the road ran down
and disappeared in the lake, as did the fence upon one side of the
road, while the placid and beautiful water extended upon the right
and left, until lost in the distance. The trees in the distance appeared
to be immersed for half their length in the lake, as if growing
in the water. Even the reflection of the trees, and of the clouds
above, was distinctly visible. We approached the vision and it
vanished.”</p>

 Because of the increasing migration westward, the National
Government decided to send out expeditions for the purpose of discovering
the best routes across the mountains to the Pacific. John
C. Fremont was selected for this task, and between 1842 and 1850
he made four journeys across the plains. Among the scouts who
acted as guides was the famous hunter and trapper, and Indian
fighter, Kit Carson.</p>

 The fact that Kansas was once an Indian country is shown
by the many Indian names of counties, towns, and streams; as,
Topeka, Pottawatomie, Hiawatha, Wyandotte, Shawnee, Cheyenne,
Cherokee, and Kiowa.</p>

 Among the schools established by the missions three have
continued in existence and have developed into important schools
of to-day: Highland College, established by the Presbyterians;
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary’s College, by the Catholics; and Ottawa University, by
the Baptists.</p>

 It should be borne in mind that many of the Missourians
who took such an active part in Kansas affairs were not representative
citizens of that state, but were of the unprincipled and outlaw
classes. Many of them were hired for this work.</p>

 Ingalls said of this period: “No time was ever so minutely
and so indelibly photographed upon the public retina. The name of
no State was ever on so many friendly and so many hostile tongues.
It was pronounced in every political speech, and inserted in every
political platform. No region was ever so advertised, and the impression
then produced has never passed away.”</p>

<p class="footnote"> <a name="footnote_13" id="footnote_13"></a>
<a href="#fnanchor_13"><span class="muchsmaller">[13]</span></a>
 This period has given rise to the expression “bleeding
Kansas.”</p>

 The origin of the word “Jayhawker” is uncertain, though a
number of different accounts have been given of it. In recent years
the term has come to be applied to our State and our people, and it
is not unusual for a Kansan to be spoken of as a “Jayhawker.”</p>

Kansans had served in the Union army.</p>

 The Populist party was formed as a result of the political
unrest following the collapse of the boom. The Populist measures
attracted widespread attention, and the party, in fusion with the
Democrats, succeeded in electing Governor Lewelling in 1892 and
Governor Leedy in 1896. By that time conditions in the State had
become more settled; with returning prosperity the political agitation
died down and the Populists were soon absorbed into the other
parties. Since that time many of the measures advocated by the
Populists have been enacted into law or are being considered by the
people of to-day.</p>

 The traveling library system in Kansas was adopted in 1900
and is now under state control through a Commission which maintains
an office in the capitol at Topeka. These traveling libraries
are made up of collections of fifty books each, selected in accordance
with the wishes of the applicant. They are sent to schools, clubs,
granges, and similar organizations without charge other than a fee
of two dollars to cover the cost of transportation. The libraries may
be retained six months, or exchanged at any time for others.</p>

<h4 class="p4 h4head">Transcriber’s Note:</h4>

<p>Only a few photographs have a source attribution. Many
may have been copied from newspapers, and some are not in focus. The texture was not
improved, so that the electronic images would be similar to the originals.</p>

<p>Inconsistent hyphenation, dialect, obsolete and alternative
spellings were left unchanged.</p>

<p>Footnotes were renumbered sequentially and moved to the end of the
book, preceding the Index. There are two anchors to Footnotes 36 and
37.</p>

<p>The following were changed:</p>
<p class="p0">Changed comma to stop at end of index entry: Democratic Party, 98.</p>
<p class="p0">Added stop to end of caption: STAGE COACH.</p>
<p class="p0">Added names of Governors to captions.</p>
<p class="p0">Corrected spelling: ecomomics to economics.</p>
<p class="p0">Removed space from Wa Keeney in appendix.</p>
